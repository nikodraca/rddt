[Produced by DVLP]

[Intro sample + Eminem]
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Six minutes. Six Minutes. Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means
We're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You are just what the doc ordered

[Hook 1]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms
Are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot

[Verse 1]
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his, nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity-rap, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a mothafuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece

[Hook 2]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms
Are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret
To rap immortality like I have got

[Verse 2]
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew)
MC's get taken to school with this music
‘Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bust a rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A., Cube, hey, Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, looking boy
You're witnessing a massacre, like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay!", that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy! What you say, looking boy?
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keeping up with the same pace, looking boy

[Hook 3]
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track
Call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton; no, Asgard, Asgard

[Verse 3]
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken; I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm
And pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case, ‘cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you, like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I tried to say
"I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9"
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya
Like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
‘Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma
You assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me
And it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
‘Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream."
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous
They confuse it; "It's not hip-hop, it's pop."
‘Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use."
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins to?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself, ‘cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you!
I'm drunk, so Satan, take the fucking wheel!
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
Then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?!
Don't mistake him for Satan; it's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard; be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?
###############
[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal
With these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, now-now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, now-now
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grinding up in that club, drunk in love

[Hook: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood
Graining-graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving-swerving on that
Big body been serving all this
Swerve, surfing all in this good-good

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember
Is our beautiful bodies
Grinding up in that club, drunk in love

[Hook: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Interlude: Jay Z]
I'm nice right now… Hold up!

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
That D'ussé is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

[Hook: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keeping me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking, watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Hook: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on
Oh word? Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju… (Okay, I got it)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin'; I'm beast

Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley, now
Vaca'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mmm, kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya; beast

[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why, why our love is so much, ohh
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much
(Thanks for warnin' me, thanks for warnin' me)

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Blue told me remind you niggas
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigga
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin', but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice; that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame; Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
And we all just entertainers

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water

[Bridge: Jay Z]
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why, why I love you so much, yeah
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why, why our love is so much

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screamin' you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail

Let the suicide doors up
I threw suicides on the tour bus
I threw suicides on the private jet
You know what that mean, I'm fly to death
I step in Def Jam buildin' like I'm the shit
Tell 'em give me fifty million or I'ma quit
Most rappers' taste level ain't at my waist level
Turn up the bass 'til it's up-in-yo-face level
Don't do no press but I get the most press kit
Plus, yo, my bitch make your bitch look like Precious
Somethin' 'bout Mary, she gone off that molly
Now the whole party is melted like Dalí
Now everybody is movin' they body

Niggas is loiterin' just to feel important
You gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Okay, now catch up to my campaign
Coupe the color of mayonnaise
I'm drunk and high at the same time
Drinkin' champagne on the airplane (Tell 'em!)
Spit rounds like the gun range, beat it up like Rampage
Hundred bands, cut your girl, now your girl need a Band-Aid
Grade A, A1, chain the color of Akon
Black diamonds, backpack rhymin', co-signed by Louis Vuitton
Horsepower, horsepower, all this Polo on, I got horsepower
Pound of this cost four thousand

Rain pourin', all my cars is foreign
All my broads is foreign, money tall like Jordan

Well! It is a weepin' and a moanin' and a gnashing of teeth
It is a weepin' and a mournin' and a gnashing of teeth
It is a... when it comes to my sound
Which is the champion sound
Believe, believe,  believe, believe

I might just snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando, remind me where I can't go

Count up hella them bands though

Hustle Gang Homie
One thing I ask of you
Lemme be the one you back that ass up to
From Malibu to Paris, boo
Had a bitch, but she ain't bad as you
So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watching and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimping
I'm a nice guy, but don't get confused, this pimpin'

Shake your rump
Get down, get up-a
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt

“We're going to skate to one song, one song only”
Ball so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
So I ball so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me
First niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a mothafucka like me?
Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even s'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here it's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho: I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broken clock, Rollies that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(Ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
If you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(Ball so hard) Let’s get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin’ Ace on my sick J’s
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave, just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi town's D. Rose, I’m moving the Nets to BK

[Hook: Jay Z and (Kanye)]
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)
Ball so hard mothafuckas want to fine me
(That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray)

[Verse 2: Kanye and (Jay Z)]
She said, "'Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all."
(Ball so hard) That shit cray that shit cray, ain’t it Jay?
(Ball so hard)
What she order what she order what she order, fish fillet?
(Ball so hard)
"Your whip so cold so cold" – this old thing?
(Ball so hard)
Act like you’ll ever be around mothafuckas like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand
Fuck that bitch; she don’t wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I’m in France, I’m just sayin'
Prince Williams ain’t do it right if you ask me
‘Cause I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley
What’s Gucci, my nigga? What’s Louis, my killa?
What’s drugs, my dealer? What’s that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I’m the illest
‘Cause I’m suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

“I don't even know what that means

No, it's not, it's gross (Gets the people going)”

You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone, don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building, they hands is to the ceiling
I know I’m 'bout to kill it; how you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne, don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone (I’m definitely in my zone)

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon ‘cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic ‘cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep; one sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, ‘cause I'm…

[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet, but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
‘Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
‘Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
‘Cause the very thing that I love's killing me
And I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head, keep knocking
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the…

[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Well, that’s nothin'
Well, that’s nothin'

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed, and
I'm coming straight at MCs, blood gets spilled, and
I'll take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it, and
Relates, that's great, it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft
Turn nothing into something, still can
Make that, straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the…

[Verse 1]
Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Hook]
Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it

Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me,  making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

[Skit]
They stomped the homie out over a bitch?
K-dot, you good, blood?
Now we can drop, ye we can drop you back off
That nigga's straight man, that nigga ain't tripping
We gon' do the same ol' shit
I'mma pop a few shots, they gon' run, they gon' run opposite ways
Fall right in ----'s lap
And he gon' tear they ass up, simple as that
And I hope that bitch that set him up out there, we gon' pop that bitch too
Wait hold up, aye I see somebody

What what, what, what [x8]
Bada, bada, bada dada

[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now, walk into the club, like, "What up, I got a big cock!"
Nah, I’m just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, “Damn, that’s a cold ass honkey!”
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink; except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
(Pissssss...) But shit, it was 99 cents!
Fuck it, coppin' it, washin' it
‘Bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins
Someone else has been walking in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it, man
I am stunting and flossing and saving my money
And I’m hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch!
I’ma take your grandpa's style, I’ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain’t got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, “Ah, he got the Velcros.”

[Hook: Wanz]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got 20 dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting
Looking for a come up

What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I’m digging, I’m digging
I’m searching right through that luggage
One man’s trash, that’s another man’s come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button-
Up shirt, ‘cause right now, I’m up in here stuntin'
I’m at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I’m not, I’m not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I’ll take those flannel zebra jammies
Second hand and I’ll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, “Oh, that Gucci? That’s hella tight”
I’m like, “Yo, that’s 50 dollars for a t-shirt.”
Limited edition, let’s do some simple addition
50 dollars for a t-shirt, that’s just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt’s hella dough, and having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don’t
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryin' to get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won’t! Man, you hella won't!

[Interlude]
Goodwill, poppin' tags, yeah!

I look incredible
I’m in this big ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road

You talkin' cash, dog, I goes all out
Shorty love the way that I floss out

Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go-dumb shit

[Outro]
Got me on that go-dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this motherfucker
Hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up! I need some more drank

[Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

[ScHoolBoy Q]
"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"

[Hook]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Verse 1]
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all, duck"
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city

[Hook]
"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

[Bridge]
If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear

[Intro: MC Eiht]
Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. Hood. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do

[Verse 2]
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month, and ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired
Cause I was inspired
By all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up
Gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking
The next weekend
We broke even
I made allegiance
That made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons
But still won't ever know my life
Kendrick, A.K.A. "Compton's human sacrifice"

[Interlude: MC Eiht]
G-yeah, cocaine, weed. Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc. Sherm sticks, butt nakeds. Dip, make a nigga flip. Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit. One time's crooked and shit. Block a nigga in. Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

[Verse 3: MC Eiht]
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of I.V.s with the fucking spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and 10 grands where a mothafucka stand

[Verse 4]
If I told you I killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what

[Scratches]
M.A.A.d city
Compton

[Skit]
Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn! You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for? Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up! Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga? Don't even trip, just lay back and drink that

[Intro: Big Sean]
I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business
I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women, yeah; that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They praying on my motherfucking downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but
You gon' get this rain, like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid, then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talking to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind
In my mind, but fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that Juicy vid
Bitch, I can't mothafuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit versus everybody
I'm so fucking first class, I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas saying they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest, because I flame drop; drop fire
And not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explaining their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddling sin, thinking maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, mothafucka, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fucking pill
I'ma pop you and give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watching the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle them both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coaching me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable; fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform, like villain Decepticons
Mollies'll probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich ass white girls looking for parties
Playing with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
(I don't smoke crack; motherfucker, I sell it!)
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aiming straight for your pelvis, you can't stomach me
You plan on stumping me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbing 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rocking no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhyming with
But this is hip-hop
And them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand-full of arthritis and popping prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast

[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders, and keep a tin of beans for when the weather turns the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgeting with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissing you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to basking in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place, tangling with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far

Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes

Yeah, but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, "Keep our business on the low-low"
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me

Only you to trust, only you

The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

I only fuck you when it's half past five

[Intro: Wale]
Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm starting to think it ain't for everybody
Most of us rushing into it anyways, you know what I'm saying
You ain't rushing for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's and make it do what it does
Let's get it

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

[Verse 1: Wale]
Lets get it
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga, college girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
Cause I heard you (bad nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex saying I love yah
But to kiss them is saying you mean that (bad nooo)
I know I just be calling her mean ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is it's probably a deep past
Still I'm feeling of something I need bad
Thinking if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by going between legs
Beg, nope, bed, floor, dope
Go, for it, couch, now
Slow, mo-tion, around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you

[Verse 2: Wale]
Let me tell you 'bout her, look
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride, in going out
Getting hollered at, and saying nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make up by the boat load
Riding through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard your winter time cold shawty fall through
Baby look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games nevermind cause they all lose
In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you sucking your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble your mean ass, look
Shawty is actually in prevent
Cause the one in front is working deep threat, yep
Bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm
Done, love, nah
Called in the morning, cell number wasn't on, goddamn

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to you
I can't promise that I'll be good to you
Cause I had some issues, I won't commit
No, not having it
But at least I can admit that I'll be bad noooooo to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed but I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love, no I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

Me and my niggas tryna git it, ya bish
Hit the house lick, tell me is you wit' it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know “Big Ballin' With My Homies”
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty of war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirting
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of them offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel

[Bridge: Anna Wise]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spillin', pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking, blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs, but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

[Hook]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel

[Outro]

[Intro: Aziz Ansari (from the movie "Funny People")]
"I'm really stepping up my game
These bitches gotta start paying me for this
Can't get no more free Randy"

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money on my mind, you should think the same
J's on, pinky ring—dogging these hoes, I need quarantine
In the same league, but we don't ball the same
(Ah) She want all the fame, I hear that shit all the time
She said she love me, I said, "Baby girl, fall in line"
Okay, made a million, off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, "Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!"
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off
And my dick so hard it make the metal detector go off
This that sauce, this that dressing
Givenchy, nigga God bless you
If having a bad bitch was a crime, I'd be arrested (Truu)

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real

[Verse 2: Drake]
I touched down in '86, knew I was the man by the age of 6
I even fucked the girl that used to babysit
But that was years later on some crazy shit
I heard your new shit, nigga hated it
Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
God damn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
God damn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
Cause myself just told myself:
"You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help"
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next
But I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'mma make it last forever
It’s not your turn ‘cause I ain't done yet
Look, just understand that I’m on a roll like Cottonelle
I was made for all of this shit
And I’m on the road box office sales
I’m getting paid for all of this shit
Ask you to please excuse my table manners
I was making room for the table dancers
Cause if we judging off your advances
Then I just got paid like eight advances, God damn!

[Hook: Drake]
Got everything, I got everything
I cannot complain, I cannot
I don't even know how much I really made, I forgot, it's a lot
Fuck that, never mind what I got
Nigga don't watch that cause I—
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me
No help, that's all me, all me for real
Came up, that's all me, stay true, that's all me—

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Ho, shut the fuck up!
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what I've been through
I'm finna do what I didn't do
And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time, man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...

[Verse 4: Drake]
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds three more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section like it's legalized
Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They dont really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine, I let you eat like that
I've been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back? (No more free Randy)
I’m blessed than a motherfucka
Niggas been stressed than a motherfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a motherfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you
Daddy was in jail we was talking through the window
Like a motherfucking drive-thru
That was back then man
Now my niggas rich enough to do whatever I do

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Every second, every minute, man I swear that she can get it
Say if you a bad bitch put your hands up high, hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talking 'bout dark room, perfume, go, go

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I recognize your fragrance, hold up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is, a little bit hmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that
Pour up plenty of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, P.S

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 2: Drake]
I really hope you play this, cause ol' girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
You've been taking clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African Girl, you too busy fucking with your other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's all right here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life but Goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin, and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doing that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, P.S

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Every time I write these words, they become a taboo
Making sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
I'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you looking in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you looking for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steering, sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, uh-huh
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, uh-huh
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly and right before you go blind, P.S

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

[Outro:Skit]
"I'm gon' ask you one more time homie, where is you from? Or it is a problem"
"Ay you over here for Sherane homie?"
"Yo I don't care who this nigga over here for, if he don't tell where he come, it's a wrap! I'm sorry"
"Hol' up hol' up hol' up, we gon' do it like this, OK? I'mma tell you where I'm from, OK? You gon' tell me where you from, OK? Or where your Grandma stay, where your mama stay, or where your daddy stay, OK?"
"Enough with all this talkin"
"Matter of fact, get out the van homie. Get out the car before I snatch you out that motherfucker homie"

[Hook]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me! Lord, forgive me!
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 1]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this

[Hook]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again

Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock

[Bridge]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me

[Outro]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
You ain't heard the Coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings
Now what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on a pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!

[Death to Molly]

Aye, K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!

Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!

Now, who with me? ¡Vámonos! Call me Hov or Jefe
Translation: I'm the shit, least that what my neck say
Least that what my check say, lost my homie for a decade
Nigga down for like 12 years
Ain't hug his son since the second grade

Bow on our arrival, the un-American idols
What niggas did in Paris, got 'em hangin' off the Eiffel
Yeah, I'm talkin' business, we talkin' CIA
I'm talkin' George Tenet, I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach, think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know, white people get money, don't spend it
Or maybe they get money, buy a business
I rather buy 80 gold chains and go ign'ant
I know Spike Lee gon' kill me, but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment, we livin' no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination, MTV cribs
Now I'm lookin' at a crib right next to where TC lives
That's Tom Cruise, whatever she accuse
He wasn't really drunk, he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments, a cool, cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crew's presence
Speedboat swerve, homie, watch out for the waves
I'm way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time I'm in Vegas they screamin' like he's Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real, got me feelin' Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli, or Gisele—no, that's Brazilian
Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?
But I been talkin' to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess he's talkin' back
Fuckin' with my clique

[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, "Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!"
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math
Like, "Yeah, I'm good at little league."
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw, nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And "God loves all his children" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book
Written thirty-five hundred years ago; I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
"Man, that's gay" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're saying
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
"Gay" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on! And be yourself!
When I was in church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans
That have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause; progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking around the hallway
Plagued by pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die
Than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient, love is kind
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)

[Hook: J. Cole]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd; totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I fill on you, I'm sayin'...

[Refrain: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you

[Bridge: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever
And, fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me 20 dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game, like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together!
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but...

[Refrain: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Hook: J. Cole]
Got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night, drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night, all I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night, constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night, down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night, got me open all night

Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, "Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back.”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
‘Cause we—

Story stayed the same, I never changed it

Even though I ain't gon' hit it, I'ma still make sure that she douche it
Me and my woadie, we don't get caught up like that, no way
We ain't got time to go see doctors, J

28 floors up I feel like I could F.L.Y.E.E
Pee on top of these bitches
God told me they can never stop me so they ain't gon' stop me

They wanna know how I got M's and I didn't finish college

I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, no- (Uh-huh, honey)

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All them other niggas lame, and you know it now
When a real nigga hold you down, you supposed to drown
Bound...

[Hook]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
(Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What you doin' in the club on a Thursday?
She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walking-round-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane 'round, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit
This that red-cup-all-on-the-lawn shit
Got a fresh cut, straight out the salon, bitch

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Close your eyes and let the word paint a thousand pictures
One good girl is worth a thousand bitches

[Hook]
Bound to fall in love
Bound to fall in love
(Uh-huh, honey)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that, give you somethin' to drink
Step back, can't get spunk on the mink
I mean damn, what would Jeromey Romey Romey Rome think?
Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson]
I know you're tired of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
Just grab somebody, no leavin' this party
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody (Uh-huh, honey)

Jerome's in the house, watch your mouth

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em, what it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn't
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp strut walking
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game nope nope y'all can't copy
Yup, Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But, I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me, on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushing labels out here, nah, they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people, spread it across the country
Labels out here, nah they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people, spread it across the country

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Now can I kick it, thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that’s what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw!
Tell me go up, gone, deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome, Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never, ever did it for a throne, that validation comes
From giving it back to the people, now sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure, gain humility, and then we keep marching, I said

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up
Oh, oh, oh, oh.....

[Bridge: Macklemore and Ray Dalton]
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey
And all my people say

Na na na na, na na na na
Hey-ee ay-ee ay-ee ay ay-ee ay-ee, hey

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Mack-le-eh-eh-eh-eh-more!

[Hook: Ray Dalton]
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight 'til it's over

Some might run against the test
Yeah those that triumph embrace the fight cause
The fear is there to prove that courage exists

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm the fuckin' man, y'all don't get it, do ya?
Type of money, everybody acting like they know ya
Go Uptown, New York City, bitch
Them Spanish girls love me like I'm Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami, too
Clubbing hard, fucking women, there ain't much to do
Wrist bling, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?
25, sitting on 25 mill
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay
Okay, getting paid, we'll holler whenever that stop
My team good, we don't really need a mascot
Tell Tune, "Light one, pass it like a relay"
YMCMB, you niggas more YMCA
Me, Franny, and Mally Mall at the crib-o
Shout goes out to Niko, J and Chubbs, shouts to Gibbo
We got Santa Margherita by the liter
She know even if I'm fucking with her, I don't really need her
That's how you feel, man? That's really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won't but then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal, real nigga, what's up?

[Hook: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin on the bench, nigga, we don't really play
Every day, every day, fuck what anybody say
Can't see 'em cause the money in the way, real nigga, what's up?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
One...time? Fuck one time
I'm calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven...grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It's Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would, like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That's my MO, add a B to that shit
I'm fucked up, tore down
I'm twisted: door knob
Talk stupid? Off with your head!
Nigga, money talks, and Mr. Ed
I'm so Young Money
Got a drum on the gun, Energizer bunny
Funny how honey ain't sweet like sugar
Ain't shit sweet? Niggas on the street like hookers
I tongue kiss her other tongue
Skeet skeet skeet: water gun
Oh my God, Becky, look at her butt! Tunechi

[Hook: Drake]
Now she want a photo, you already know, though
You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO
And we bout it every day, every day, every day

[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, cause...

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
"Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G
Been have up di ting dem from time, G
So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
Y'all need to know yourself."

Fuck bein' on some chill shit

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga

If niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest then I'm headed for it
That mean I'm way up (way up)
The 6 ain't friendly but that's where I lay up
This shit a mothafuckin' lay up

Fuck all that "Drake you gotta chill" shit

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko's basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

That's my nigga
Oh Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it
I run this shit, they like "Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest"
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up
Valuable lesson, man I had to grow up
That's why I never ask for help
I'll do it for you niggas and do it for myself

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, ‘cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em "Stick it!"
So sick I'm looking pale, wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, ‘cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's banging, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowing down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho...

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, ‘cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say "Fuck it!" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls

[Scratch]

[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh, sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you a loan; car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick, word man, you heard
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Pre-Hook]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, ‘cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go

Goddamn I feel amazing, damn I'm in the matrix
My mind is living on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation

Popping pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hating, shooters go after Judas

Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast but I never get embarrassed

They say, "K, you going marry mines"
Beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, no way, beeotch, okay
I'm never living life confined, I can feel you even if I'm blind
I can tell ya who what when where how to sell your game right on time

She pussy popping and I got options like an audible, I be

You lil, you lil dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil stupid ass

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit, like, "I don't fuck with you."
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and everyday I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Hook: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)

Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin', like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me, like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…

Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-eleven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking babe

[Bridge]
Boy this all for you just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking babe
Just tell me how it's looking babe

I do this all for you baby just take aim
And tell me how it's looking babe
(How it's looking babe)
Tell me how it's looking babe, looking babe

Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
Cuz when he wanna smash I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

Coke on her black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die, the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap
Preach

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days...
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know whether it's disco and rock but we just went in the studio and we did it. We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow...

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, after hours of Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now?
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all
Every single round y'all
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feelin' us
The homies said "Hov, it ain't many of us"
I told 'em less is more niggas, plenty of us

[Hook: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me
C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dolla-dolla bill y'all

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, cake
500 million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uhh
I'm just gettin' started, oh, yeah, we got it bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelins
I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's tryna chase this cash
Gucci air bag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil, Jesus grab the wheel
###############
[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How can we not talk about family
When family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

[Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah

[Intro]
Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again

[Verse]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley
You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad ‘cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill!!!

[Verse 1]
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves

[Bridge]
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

[Verse 2]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys
Fuck it, c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?

[Outro: Kanye West & Frank Ocean]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long, you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again, too high)

[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell
(A two man cell)
Something's in the water (something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (oh yeah)

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge, I made it past 25, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

[Hook]
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'—(*POP*)
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—(*POP*)
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro]
(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk

Yah, say Roro, you know what it is, right?
Who Is Rickey Wayne?: The Mixtape
Ya feel me? Yah, ahem

[Verse]
First, let me hop out the muh fuckin' Porsche
I don't want her if that ass don't sit like a horse
I be ballin' on these niggas, got me feelin' like sports
Dash got so much wood I could build me a fort
Ain't too many things I ain't done yet
I'm the king of this shit, crown by the toilet
I'm just barely gettin' started, you already upset
Got a tiger as a pet, I just took him to the vet
Homie, I be makin' hits, I'm the rap Derek Jeter
Let your bitch ride on me like she was on the feeder
If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her
I ain't worried 'bout features, homeboy, you's a peon
Toilet seat ass nigga, man, I swear you gettin' peed on
Man, my jewelry so cold, I walk around with the heat on
My alarm clock set, just in case they wanna sleep on, ya dig?
I'm a full-time player, hoppin' out in alligator
Sippin' lean and Now and Later, homie, I'll annihilate ya
If you think you wanna battle, you gon' have to pay some paper
I just hit her and I quit her, I would never ever date her
It's a shame how I'm barely gettin' love in the city
Travel to another town, you can bet they fuckin' with me
I be killin' this shit, pray to God they forgive me
They said, "when you blow up, don't forget me", man
I been on fire ever since they made the lighter
My boys will pull up on ya, homie, I ain't talkin' diapers
Walk into your function, on point, I'm like a sniper
My girl bad like Dej Loaf so don't try her
Flexin' all you want but homeboy, you ain't ready
Ten times sharper than Michael Myers' machete
Been about the money, I ain't worried 'bout the fame
'Bout to have everybody sayin', "Who Is Rickey Wayne?"
That me...

[Intro]
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang

[Verse 1]
I'm a fuckin' walking paradox—no, I'm not
Threesomes with a fuckin' triceratops, Reptar
Rappin' as I'm mockin' deaf rock stars
Wearing synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfucking Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper tryin' to get grown
About 5'7" of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'ma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is telling me
That she's been getting intimate with men
(Syd, shut the fuck up!) Here's the number to my therapist
(Shit!) You tell him all your problems
He's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

[Verse 2]
Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitchin', this isn't a fuckin' hotline
For a fuckin' shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fuckin' working
I think I'm wasting my damn time
I'm clocking three past six and going postal
This the revenge of the dicks; that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V Tech shit or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
(What'd you do?) I slipped myself some pink Xannies
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
(What you think of Hayley Williams?)
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbing 'em
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver?
Green paper, gold teeth and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got something to feed 'em
It's some cooking books
The black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave, damn

[Verse 3]
They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report
I'm stabbin' any blogging faggot hipster with a Pitchfork
Still suicidal I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fuckin' knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fuckin' hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved the cock in your bitch
(What the fuck, man?) Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just want to know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' Goblin
(Fuck everything, man!) That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder
Now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit, dead

[Intro: Drake]
Gotta do what I gotta do

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where, tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only "hello" or a "happy belated"
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
Then right after texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl I'm still fucking with ya
Damn, is it the fall, time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call, there's albums to drop
There's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her pills, she started confessing
And started undressing and ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure
Damn, she say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But, interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom
Confusing me with questions like...

[Hook: Lil Wayne (& Drake)]
Do you love this shit? Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single? I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
(And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn' right, alright, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl I always stay down, get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?
You might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Verse 2]
And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl don't treat me like a stranger, girl you know I seen you naked
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition
But you been missin' girl and you might feel like nothin' was the same

[Hook]
I still been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I still been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin' on the low, mobbin' on the low
Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low
I just been plottin' on the low, schemin' on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

[Bridge]
Drinkin', smokin', fuckin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money
Drinkin', fuckin', smokin', plottin'
Schemin', plottin', schemin', gettin' money

[Verse 3]
This the life for me
My momma told me this was right for me
I got 'em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me
I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different
This the shit I wanna go out to
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin'
Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'
A nigga fillin' up arenas, who the fuck could see us?
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up
Yours truly, the boy
I just build and build more, y'all niggas build to destroy
Y'all niggas party too much, man, I just chill and record
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't feel it before

[Outro]
Yes, Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to
Yeah yeah, this the shit I wanna go out to

Strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
Blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
Now I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want something out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

[Verse 2]
We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happenin'

[Verse 3]
You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

[Bridge]
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'd die for my...

[Verse 4]
To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That goin' to that owin' money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie, yeah
'til death but do your part, unholy matrimony

[Outro]
That summer night holdin' long and long, 'din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and (breathe)
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn
And live and learn
And livin' and livin' like I’m lonely
Lonely, lonely
And livin' all I have
And livin' all
And live
And live
###############
[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Intro: Beyoncé]
Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
An innocent love I'm misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Toast to clichés in a dark past

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces, chugging D'usse ugh
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long I'm next to you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
Why

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but

[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tats, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Ugh
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'mma wave this Tec, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack
Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl
'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming

[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Deeper than words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but

[Outro: Beyoncé]
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
(Without you I got nothing to lose)

I stopped the world
Male or female, it make no difference
I stop the world, world stop...
Carry on

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Kitty on fleek, pretty on fleek
Pretty gang always keep them niggas on geek
Ridin' through Texas, feed him for his breakfast
Everytime I whip it, I be talkin' so reckless
He said "Damn Nicki it's tight," I say "Yeah nigga you right"
He said "Damn, bae, you so little, but you be really takin' that pipe"
I said "Yes daddy I do, gimme brain like NYU"
I said "Teach me, nigga, teach me. All this learnin' here is by you"

(Migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine, migraine)
Ridin' through Texas, ridin' through Texas

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Keep gettin' gifts from Santa Claus at the North Pole
Today I'm icy, but I'm prayin' for some more snow
Let that ho ho, let that ho know -- he in love with that coco
Why these bitches don't never be learnin'?
You bitches will never get what I be earnin'
I'm still gettin' plaques, from my records that's urban
Ain't gotta rely on top 40,I am a Rap legend
Just go ask the Kings of Rap, who is the Queen and things of that
Nature? Look at my finger, that is a glacier, hits like a laser
Drippin' on that work, trippin' off that perc
Flippin' up my skirt and I be whippin' all that work
Takin' trips with all them ki's, car keys got B's
Stingin' with the Queen Bey and we be whippin' all of that D
Cause we dope girls we flawless, we the poster girls for all this
We run around with them ballers, only real niggas in my call list
I'm the big kahuna, go let them whores know
Just on this song alone, bitch is on her fourth flow

[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
I gotta close the window before I record
‘Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Stand up!

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Coogi down to the socks, like I'm Biggie poppa
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
‘Cause you know the Fergenstein getting plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shining in the Benzo
Ballin', got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer, then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the building, semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they getting on my nerves
I ain't lying, lay 'em on the curb
Ridin' on a killer who be coming at Ferg (Damn)
Girl, you twerk, twerk that kitty, girl, make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel, he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with an all-gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
ScHoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World

[Verse 2: French Montana]
(Haaan!) That ain't Kanye
That's Montana, loose cannon
He shot me, so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten homis on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin' for your life
Baby, don't pray for me, pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies

[Hook]
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt

[Verse 3: Trinidad James]
Shout out that motherland, 12-years-old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga
All they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad, I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica, I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI, yeah-yeah-yeah, that's my partner
You got a problem with it
Then-then-then-then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas and I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me
But that don't get no deal, I said no, that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle
Immigration give you nothing but work (Put it in work)

[Verse 4: ScHoolboy Q]
YAWK-YAWK, YAWK-YAWK!
A lot of niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No, I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33, move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28, Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y, I'm in your state, eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay, super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip, she say she never had a Crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make it twerk
All big titties lift your shirt, show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front of the church
Deacon said I did my shit, the pastor said, "That nigga turnt."
Pop my collar on my shirt, make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units; Captain Kirk, takin' xannies, poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb you first
Turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth
Had to give Young Ferg a verse

[Verse 5: A$AP Rocky]
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Out of line, pistols barkin' *argh argh*, ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress, side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See, my daddy in Heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks
Loaded Lux; put in work

You the realest nigga breathing if I hold my breath
Referee, with the whistle, brrrrrt, hold his tech
Extendo clip, extendo roll
When your girl leave me she need a hair salon
Hair weave killer going on a trapathon
See I done had more bombs than Pakistan
Dope bomb, dro bomb, and a pill bomb
See nigga, I'm balling, you in will call

When I die, bury me inside the Truey store
True to my religion, two everything I'm too different

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ah, Yeezy Yeezy how you do it huh
It's my birthday, I deserve to be greedy huh
She holding out, she ain't giving to the needy huh
You go downstairs and fall asleep with the TV on
Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit
We in Kanye West's Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

[Hook: 2 Chainz]
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
And how I come up with this shit up in the studio

Bad bitch contest, you in first place
You in first place, you in first place

(Then hand the valet the keys to the Merces)
Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on
(What I'm seeing from the back I can't front on)
They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't know why they been lyin'
But your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statements just look like
I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum!
I looked at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it

[Hook: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Now you're talkin' my language
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm 'bout to roll one and light it
And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit
That's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny, you don't even know
'Bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with you back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl, she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
I been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Hook: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."
Okay, now you're talkin' my language

Been ready, it's real, I don't know 'bout you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said "Girl, that's all that we do."

[Outro: Birdman]
Famous and dangerous, you understand me?
Showtime, headlines, big time
Sunshine, tote 9's, bust mines
Flatline, hard grind, high life
Stay fly, it's jet time – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Every time you see a nigga – stunt, nigga!
Swag on head to feet nigga – stunt, nigga!
I just might bring in some girls from Miami
To heat up the city, and that's word to Stunna, you know it

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that block-ow
Dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet
It's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas
Don’t try me, I’ll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game’s so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture

No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?

[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true, that’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out
And I say: "Damn, that makes two of us."
Aww, that look like what’s her name
Chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like
So one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm
Go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full
So I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back
We don’t talk shit, we just state facts, yes, Lord

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some
I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass
Take him out, bring 'em in, them whole things
2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t
Went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!)
YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy

[Hook: Drake]
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiending
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face, frenchy, freaking, swapping tongue
Click my link and spread your buns, lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Fucking in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, prolly off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, popping since the intro
You shopping from the window, play my favorite tempo

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up, biatch, this your favorite song
Translation: Ven aqui, mami, ese culo
Tu quieres coger mis huevos, y papi me desespero
Chuparse puto pendejo, el pinche cabron - let's get it
Nights like this, I'm a knight like this, sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a God, bitch, touche, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo, doo-doo," bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this, I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, I'm forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down, alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics, popping out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steering, ah!

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching could buy anything, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Bummy nigga famous, straight from the bottom
Broke niggas hate it, still never robbed him
Guns in the basement, out they have a problem
Kush be my fragrance, we love marijuana
Function on fire, burn the roof off this mothafucka
Psych ward is balling, go craze like no other
Weed steady blowing, pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiending
Faded, faded-faded right
Shot glass super size, sHe gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no it's not the Westside
Stick it up ya Southside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year, I spend that on my daughter shoes
Smoking weed and drinking, all the college students loving Q
We gon' turn it out until the neighbors wanna party too

[Hook: ScHoolboy Q]
Oh, oh, luxury
Chidi-ching-ching could buy anytHing, cop that
Oh, oh, collard greens
Three degrees low, make it hot for me, drop that
Oh, oh, down with that shit
Drink this, smoke this, get down with the shit
Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit
Cop this, pop this, down with the shit

[Intro: Drake & Big Sean]
Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... look)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed

This ain't for no fuck-nigga
If you a real nigga, then fuck with me
This one for the hood niggas
Hipster bitches that shop at Lenox
Dark skinned, light skinned
Asian and white women
Hypebeasts we know aboutchea'
Don't buy shoes unless they popular
For the hoes, my nigga
That's pussy poppin' at Magic City
Got that strong, my nigga
Then come match that shit with me
Smokin' mid, my nigga
Then don't pass that shit to me
This one for my niggas
And bitches 'bout that money (Cash Out)
Gotta love, Chesire Bridge
Them bad hoes at Onyx
I don't fuck with no snitches
So don't tell me who tellin'
This one for them colleges
Them bad hoes at Spelman
Shout out to them freshmen
On Instagram straight flexin'
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo
Mama always told me: "Boy, count your blessings."
In God I trust, so I kept counting them Franklins
I'm too fly, you know this
Let me give your ass a checklist
One gold watch, two gold chains
Six gold rings, it's nothin' (Goddamn!)
OG Jordans, them high socks
No shirt on, I'm stuntin' (Okay!)
And this song for them fuck-niggas
Who hating on you this summer (Fuck 'em!)
Talk shit behind your back
But won't say shit in public (Fuck 'em!)

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo! I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Worried 'bout if my butt fake, worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens, unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me: Lance Stephenson

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, "god damn, this is the perfect time"
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey or maybe highkey
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it
(Pinkprint, aye)

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga, I been praising, my nigga
That money talk; I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the "B" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from "poor me"
To "please pour me a drink and celebrate with me"

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Verse 1]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club (mm-mm)
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah...It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah.. it's whatever
You know, feeling good - living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got 10 years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, "Why do you worry?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...

[Outro]
Three in the morning still going down…

Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, who just got a check

If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us
I'm MC Hammer fly, you can't touch
J's so fly I should work at Flight Club

More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan
Smiley, Miley, come swing the thing right by me
Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain’t no different
These days it’s hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I’ve been avoiding commitment
That’s why I’m in this position
I’m scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it’s just me, but I am not alone
But if you’re alone then, say my name, say my name

[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, “Baby, I love you”
If you ain’t running games
Say my name, say my name
You actin’ kinda shady, baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
If no one is around you

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Uh
Say my name, say my name
‘Cause those other men are practice
And this ain’t no time for actin’
And this ain’t no time for games
And this ain’t no time for uncertainty
And this ain’t no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin’ some shit when I’m in the zone
This is why I’ve been saying
No new friends, no no no
You know how this shit goes
This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys ‘round me saying, “Get money and fuck these hoes”
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I’m just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that’ll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
‘Cause we don’t wanna hide no more
Plus you’re not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I’m not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

[Hook]

[Hook: TLC]
Even though I
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
They tell me I should fix my grill, ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked – look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich, and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows; thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killing yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on, stare in the mirror
But it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, "Why you gotta take so long?!"
What it's like to have a crooked smile

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down(this crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you asking
So all you see is what you lacking, not what you packing
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is something that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Bridge: J. Cole + TLC]
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
We don't look nothing like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation, that’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation
Or in jail, wonder why we inhale
‘Cause we in Hell already, I asked if my skin pale
Would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody getting killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, I'm well now
If you asking will I tell now – ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitching ‘cause man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around, then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?

[Hook: TLC]
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down(this crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Bridge: J. Cole + TLC]
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em (back 'round)
Crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Ad-Libs: Choir]

[Outro: Choir]
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round
Back 'round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round
Back 'round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back 'round

[Verse 1]
Worst...
Mothafucka never loved us
Fucka never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit...
Niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'...
Nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
Cause man it's a mission, tryna fight to the finish
Just to see if I'm finished

[Hook]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 2]
Hold up, hold my phone
Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Mothafucka never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Mothafucka, I done grown up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything
When it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch you better have my money
When I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Hook]
On my worst behavior, no? They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka!
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior! Don't you ever get it fucked up!
Mothafuckas never loved us! Man, mothafuckas never loved us
Worst behavior! Mothafuckas never loved us
Fucka never loved us! Worst behavior

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not? Tell me who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop, whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessins at my grandmother's grave
And it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the border line
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

[Outro]
Remember? Remember? Mothafucka, remember?
Hold up, hold my phone, they used to never want to hear us
Remember? Mothafucka never loved us
Remember? Mothafucka, remember? Worst behavior

[Intro: Swae Lee]
Yah, bad bitches is the... yah

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Chop the top off the Porsche, that's a headless horse
Extendo long as an extension cord
Bitch, I ball like Jordan and I play full court
And if you not my type then you know I got to keep this shit short
What you know about a check? What you got up in your pocket?
What you spending when you shopping, dawg?
Why you wanna go flex? Like you all in the mix
Like you got some shit popping off
I got some models that you see up in the movies
And they want to make a flick for the camera
Wanna be Kim Kardashian, heard I was livin' like a bachelor

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 2: Slim Jimmy]
Spend it how I like, sinnin' every night
Push start the whip, brought it straight to life
Blowin' on the kush, 'til I'm out of sight
I don't check the price, all I do is swipe
She said, "What's your type?", I said, "I like what I like"
I don't second guess, I just roll the dice (keep it moving)
Keep your two cents, take your own advice
I've been livin' life, like I lived twice

[Hook: Swae Lee]
I don't got no type
Bad bitches is the only thing that I like
You ain't got no life
Cups with the ice and we do this every night
I ain't check the price
I make my own money, so I spend it how I like
I'm just livin' life
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Outro]
I don't got no type, I don't got no type
And let my mama tell it, nigga, I ain't livin' right

[Verse 1]
For my theme song (black)
My leather black jeans on (black)
My by-any-means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom (black)
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in (black)
Came to see me in my black skin (black)
Number one question they're askin'
Fuck every question you askin' (black)
If I don't get ran out by Catholics (black)
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go (down)
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control (now)
But there's nowhere to go (now)
And there's no way to slow (down)
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'

Stop all that coon shit (black)
Early morning cartoon shit (black)
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit

Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch (black)
Black out the room, bitch (black)
Stop all that coon shit (black)
These niggas ain't doin' shit (black)
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathin', you gaspin'
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action

[Hook]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen

I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

You can ride my face until you're drippin' cum
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?

I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save ya
Baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favors
Pussy so good, had to save that shit for later
Took her to the kitchen, fucked her right there on the table
She repping XO to the death
I'm tryna make these bitches sweat
I'm tryna keep that pussy wet
I'm tryna fuck her and her friends

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]

Girl, is you sucking me or fucking me or nah?

Keep saying you's a freak, you gon' prove it or nah?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, thinkin' out loud—
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here?
Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends
And you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house
Are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change, all white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka—new flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Whoop!—talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, thinkin' out loud—
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, thinkin' out loud—
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy, cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say "I know"—can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet, I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name?—not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunechi and Barbie
You know—

Ya'll been together ten years, you deserve a ménage
Especially if you put that BMW in the garage
Especially if you paid a couple payments on her Mamma crib
Went to her niece's graduation, man I hate those kids
Last birthday she got you a new sweater
Put it on, give her a kiss, and tell her do better
She said how bout I get you jewelry from the West End
How bout she hit the Westin and get her best friend
I'm joking, I'm just serious, I asked her
Don't be acting like no actress, if we preaching then we practice
Don't be reaching, don't be touching shit
We in Kanye West's Benz
Cause I will turn you back to a pedestrian

Tell the DJ play your song, this shit come on

They ask me what I do and who I do it for
When I die, bury me inside the booty club
Get it girl, get it girl, get it get it girl

On the job and the bitch overslept

Don't let me tell ya twice, already told you once
(Eat that pussy!)
Who got that baddest pussy on the planet?
D-Boyz love me, they don't understand it
Ooooooooooooooooooh! Deeeep throoooooat!
Million dollar pussy might pounce on that ass
Threw them hundreds until I lose count on that ass
Max out all of them accounts on that ass
Million dollar checks don't bounce on that ass
Pull up in that you can't afford this
Only rap bitch on the Forbes list
Pussy jewelry make em say burr man
R-r-r-rubs hands like Birdman

[Hook: Future]
[Interlude: Birdman]
She got that million dollar, Million dollar oow, oow  (Rich Gang and Rich Girl)
She got that million dollar (Sexy Slim, I see you)
(Paradise home, flossing while you're shining)
Million dollar oow, oow (Jumping out Bugattis, fuck the money game up)
And all I want to do is touch it,touch it,touch it, touch it (oow, oow) (Why? I don't know)
Make her tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout
And I'm gon' make her tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout, tapout
Sweet D! Love you babygirl

[Outro: Detail]
I’m in love with your Egyptian skin
And your talk about religion
I’m in prison with the pussy
And I’m ballin' no cushion

[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005, hold up

[Verse 1]
Hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
"My God, you pay for your friends?" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
Till 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up

[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (say what)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)...

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)...

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hold up

[Hook]
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005, hold up

[Spoken Outro]

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till 3005
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)
Hold up, (hold up), hold up, (hold up)...

Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up...

We did it! Yay!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Fraud niggas, y'all niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Your shit make-believe, rapping 'bout my own life
Real names kill things, that's that shit I won't write
‘Cause my niggas still selling dope
Like they ain't on their third strikes
Camping out in that corridor, fuck you waiting on Jordans for?
I middle-man it for 23
Just meet me somewhere around Baltimore
(Woo!) That's rare, nigga (Woo!) Ric Flair, nigga
(Woo!) The power's in my hair, nigga
(Woo!) I give this beat the chair, nigga
SoHo or Tribeca, three hoes; trifecta
Dope money, hope money, Hublot, my watch better
My pen's better, you don't write, trendsetter, you clone-like
Pay homage or K's vomit, ungrateful niggas I don't like; rrrah!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
(This Chicago, nigga!)
They smile in my face is what I don't like
They steal your whole sound; that's a soundbite
The media crucify me, like they did Christ
They want to find me not breathing, like they found Mike
A girl'll run her mouth only out of spite
But I never hit a woman, never in my life
I was in too deep, like Mekhi Phife'
In that pussy so deep I could have drowned twice
Rose gold Jesus piece with the brown ice
Eating good; vegetarian with the brown rice
Girls kissing girls, ‘cause it's hot, right?
But unless they use a strap-on then they not dykes
They ain't about that life, they ain't about that life
We hanging out that window it's about to be a Suge night
Free Bump J, real nigga for life
Shoutout to Derrick Rose, man, that nigga nice
Shout out to L-E-P, Jay Boogie, right?
Chief Keef, King Louie, this is Chi, right? Right?!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like
Don't like, don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
(Young Chop on the beat)
Fake Gucci, that's that shit that I don't like
Smokin' on this dope, higher than a kite
This bitch gon' love me now, she gon' let me pipe
Screaming: "Sosa, that's that nigga that I like!"
I don't want relations, I just want one night
‘Cause a thirsty bitch, that's the shit that I don't like
I got tats up on my arm, ‘cause this shit is life
And I stunt so much in clothes, ‘cause I'm livin' life
I come up on the scene, and I'm stealin' light
Bitch, I'm high off life, got me feelin' right
Bitch, I'm Chief Keef, fuck who don't like
And, bi-bi-bitch, we GBE, we just go on sight

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
We are not one and the same
Nigga, I'm fuckin' insane, fuck is you sayin'?
Yo' ass been doing the same
Shit, not doing what you sayin'
Dang, I told yo' old bitch she was fucking a lame
Turn one ho to a train
Blaow, blang, my niggas holding that pain
I just hope you been prayin'
Bang bang! Ridin' for my niggas, and that's for life
High class, I'm just surrounded by these lowlives
And I run this bitch like it's no lights
Going hard the whole night
‘Cause I ain't going back to my old life, I promise

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Verse 5: Jadakiss]
I done sold purple, I done sold white
Runnin' outta work, that's that shit I don't like
She never let me hit it, she gave me dome twice
She blowin' up my phone, that's that bitch I don't like
Nah, jean jacket with the sleeves cut
Put the pressure on 'em, just when they think that I eased up
Thirty for the Cuban, another 30 for the Jesus
Believe in ourselves when nobody else believed us, suckas!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Sneak disser, that's that shit I don't like

[Hook: Big Sean and Jhene Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
Cause by now she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying fuck you, I miss you or I hate you so much
Cause girls only say "hate you" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes and goes
You say "be real" I try, I don't
Cause you take anything and just make it everything
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring (Funny, right?)
And I never cheated (I mean, maybe once, twice)
One time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy
I drank too much, please call me a cabby
Penthouse after party hoes want that addy
Fuck they can ride with us, crawl in a Caddy
Third row is when you call, I hit cancel
Really? I hit answer, fuck I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like "Why you still talk to my mama?"
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo?
Man, fuck this tattoo you the reason I wasn't single in college
What? All because I had you, nigga I dont even have you
How am I suppose to get past you?
And she called the next guy spillin' some real shit
Now they problems he got to deal with

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Muah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, "ain't no woman like the one I got"
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that would make me a one eyed fuck
Sch, I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Hook]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Baby, last time calling me baby
Last time calling me crazy, crazy, crazy

[Verse 1]
Pull up to the scene, but my roof gone
When I leave the scene, bet your boo gone
And I beat the pussy like a new song
2 Chainz but I got me a few on
Everything hot, skip lukewarm
Tell shawty to bust it open, Uncle Luke on
Got the present for the present and a gift wrapping
I don't feel good, but my trigger happy
But the stripper happy, but they wish they had me
And I wish a nigga would, like a kitchen cabinet
And me and you are cut from a different fabric
I fucked her so good it's a bad habit
Bitch sit down, you got a bad atti'
Gave her the wrong number and a bad addy
You ain't going nowhere like a bad navi
Ass so big, I told her to look back at it
Look back it, look back it
Then put a fat rabbit on the Craftmatic
I am so high...attic
I am so high like an...addict

[Verse 2]
2 Chainz got your girl on the celly
And when I get off the celly
I made her meet at the telly
When she meet at the telly
I put it straight in her belly
When it go in the belly, it ain't shit you can tell me
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
Hair long, money long
Me and broke niggas we don't get along
I paid a thousand dollars for my sneakers
Ye told ya, a 100k for a feature
Eee-err Eee-err, sound of the bed
Beat it up, beat it up, then I get some head
Well I might get some head, then I beat it up
I don't give a fuck, switch it up, nigga live it up
Yeah it's going down, so get up
Might valet park a Brinks truck

Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say
Cannot keep you out my brain
But first off I'ma start by saying this, ayy
All headshots if you think you could take my bitch, ayy
And I'm too turnt, when I shoot, swear I won't miss, ayy
Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?
Baby, won't you come my way?

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
Ba-Ba-Baby
This is something you should know
I don't ever chase no hoes
I spotted you, you had that glo
Watch me pull out all this dough
Take you where you want to go
Flexin' on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out
Barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth
When his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out
Didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy
I got deep pockets, I swear my shit's on sink, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap in her dreams, ayy
Well he mad as fuck, when they sex, she scream for me, ayy
Big ZooWap what these niggas should be, ayy

Ba-Baby, won't you come my way?

[Verse 2: Drake]
All I gotta do is put my mind to this shit (goddamn)
Cancel out my ex, I put a line through that bitch
I like all my S's with two lines through them shits
Everybody tryna fuck you but I'm fine with that shit
I never mind, girl that's just you
I know you work hard for your shit
You know they gon' hate
Just don't play no part in that shit
They should call me James
Cause I'm goin' hard in this bitch
We're just so much smarter than them
Maybe I just needed you around me
Drank a lot tonight, I know
She can drive your car and you can roll
Take you where you wanna go
First off, I'ma start by sayin' this
Goddamn, goddamn

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
Baby, won't you come my way?
Got something I want to say

Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk

[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang
See he did come back tho)

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice

[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus

[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air, all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh

[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up

[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
[?]
[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go

[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)

[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!) fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please

[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit, that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches

[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011, yeah

If I weren't rapping I'd be trapping
If I weren't trapping I'd be pimping
If I weren't pimping I'd be getting it, period
I don't smoke no bobby, but my denim be from ricky
Got your girl on molly and we smokin' loud and drinkin'
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin'
If you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin
Money, thousands, True Religion trousers
Got a private home, started from them public houses
Hair weave killer, causing her arousal
Audi A8, told them "outtie 5000," uh

Damn, damn what they say about me?

[Verse 1]
Tell me whatcha say now?
Tell me whatcha say
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
Cause you got me face down

[Bridge 1]
And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts I know
I just can't keep runnin' away

[Hook]
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you

[Verse 2]
Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

[Bridge 2]
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
Til I made you so
You better act like you know
That I've been through worse than you
I just can't keep runnin' away

[Hook]
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
[I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you]

[Verse 3]
Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like him
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
God damn baby, my mind's blown
I be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And yea I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

[Bridge 3]
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

[Outro]
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I still want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I, but I love you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
But I love you

And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it

And I know she'll be the death of me

All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it

[Intro]
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to a God)
I want everything black (That we don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

[Bridge]
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Hook]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Hook: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 3]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

Flexin' on your ex, I know
He ain't ever take you out
Barely even left your house
How dare that nigga run his mouth
When his pockets in a drought
The last single he put out
Didn't even make it out
And he dumb as hell and I swear his ass don't think, ayy
If he disrespect, two shots and I won't blink, ayy
Never really cared what the fuck these niggas think, ayy
I got deep pockets, I swear my shit's on sink, ayy
And he mad as fuck, big ZooWap all she sing, ayy

Cancel out my ex, I put a line through that bitch
I like all my S's with two lines through them shits
Everybody tryna fuck you but I'm fine with that shit
I never mind, girl that's just you
I know you work hard for your shit
You know they gon' hate
Just don't play no part in that shit
They should call me James
Cause I'm goin' hard in this bitch
We're just so much smarter than them
Maybe I just needed you around me
Drank a lot tonight, I know
She can drive your car and you can roll
Take you where you wanna go
First off, I'ma start by sayin' this
Goddamn, goddamn

Got a Brinks truck in my pocket
Thirty chains on my collar
Two drops, no mileage
Top off like Wallace
And I’m inhaling smoke, bitch know that

Three beans I’m on that (Haaan)
We pop a molly, she buss it open (Haaan)

Let's get these hoes on the Molly
You know I came to stunt
So drop that pussy, bitch
I got what you want, drop that pussy, bitch
Film it, film it, this bitch want me to film it
Balling, balling like I play for New England
Spend it, spend it, spend a stack every minute
That's 50...100, I see no fucking limits
Shout out to Uncle Luke
Shout out my bitches too
We the 2 Live Crew
Two for me, two for you
Feed them bitches carrots
Fuck em like a rabbit
Sorry that's a habit, smoke a spliff and then I vanish

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
I'm about being single, seeing double, making triple
I hope you pussy niggas hating never make a nickel
It's good to make it better when your people make it with you
Money coming, money going, ain't like you could take it with you
It's about to be a hit right now, fuck back then we the shit right now
Dropped Take Care, bought a mothafuckin' crib
Picking up the keys to that bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's mayor shit
Gettin cheddar packs like KD, OKC that's player shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man fuck you and your time difference
I'm Young Papi, champagne
They know the face and they know the name
Got one watch that could probably pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, twenty bottles that's on me
On the couch, wildin' out yelling free my niggas 'til they all free
One of my closest dawgs got three kids and they all three
But we always been that type of crew that been good without a plan B

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Bitch! Stop talkin' that shit
And suck a nigga dick for some Trukfit
Okay I fuck a bitch and I'm gone
That’s gangsta: Al Capone
I make that pussy spit like Bone
I'm talkin' 'bout bone, bone, bone bone
I’m fuckin with French, excuse my French
I lose my mind before I lose my bitch
Money ain’t a thing but a chicken wing
Bitch I ball like two eyelids
YMCM beat that pussy up, stop playin'
I make her ass scream and holla like rock bands
I’m a beast, I’m off the leash
I am rich like a bitch
On my Proactiv shit, pop that pussy like a zit
I go by the name Lil Tunechi
Your girl is a groupie
And nigga, you's a square
And I will twist you like in a Rubik's
Motherfucker I'm on my skateboard
Watch me do a trick ho
I’m 5′5” but I could 6-9
Then beat that pussy like Klitschko
It’s French Montana, fuck Joe
It’s Weezy F, fuck hoes
It’s Truk the world
It’s Truk yo girl
It’s Trukfit by the truck load, biatch!

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls, and they end  up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a potluck, you need to come with it
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin' 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself
That she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down
I'm writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
Ohhh, don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through, ohhh
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you, ohhh,ohhh
(Don't do that..)

[Outro: Sampha]
Don't give up, on your hopes
And you tell me somethin's gone wrong
Wholehearted, wholehearted, you care, you care
Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense
Well if it's all a dream
Then I'm on fire, feels like, I'm on fire
Tell me when I'm lyin', tell me when I'm tryin'
###############
[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Catch me rollin' through the city
Ridin' with the top off
Man my whip so big when you in it
Fuck around and get lost
Told my bitch let her hair down
What this shit cost
Tell me baby if you about that life right now
Hope it ain't talk

[Pre-Hook: Jeremih]
I can put you in the Mile High Club, what's up?
Let's take a trip
Have you ever read "The World Is Yours"
On a blimp

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Tell her be free, baby spread your wings
Got your legs in the sky like a plane
Let me guide that, I'm the pilot
Can't nobody see you, 30 thousand feet
On your knees in them Prada's
Make the freaky shit come up out her

[Hook: Jeremih]
Get high baby roll one, cloud nine, 'bout to go up
Lovin' the feelin' of turbulence get when we turn up
When we land we can roll out, show you something you don't know about
Tonight we be takin' off flight with a camera to show about

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
I got you in the air, your body in the air
How it feel up here?
You can scream as loud as you want, and loud as you can
And ain't nobody gonna hear it
Would you like it better
If we hit the west coast?
Tell me, if you 'bout that life right now
I hope it ain't talk

[Pre-Hook] + [Bridge] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I got that golden ticket, we should just go and kick it
This the factory
Listen to Kels order daiquiris
With your bitches
Gettin' drunk as fuck
See a bitch I fucked then get mad at me
Listen to Kels then get back with me
Cause I could fix broken bridges, she could never burn 'em
Yeezy taught her well, he ain't ever gonna learn her
You would be a liar if you said I didn't want her
But candy is so delicious, this shit sweet
I be hitting other bitches like this shit weak
This the worst pussy I had all week
But you got that golden ticket
Fuck the airfare we should have a affair
Life's real unfair to the ones scared
Life really ain't a game when it's one player
That's scary huh
Very huh, like it when I beat the pussy up like Jerry vs Tom
With a bat like Barry Bonds
She said she had too much baggage to carry on
You make me optimistic
We should just go and kick it
You got that golden ticket
We got some golden tickets, IGH!

Own it
It's yours
It's yours

[Verse 1 - Drake]
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

[Hook - Partynextdoor]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it

[Verse 2 - Drake]
Niggas talk more than bitches these days (Just let that shit sink in)
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time? You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

[Outro - Partynextdoor]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit

First things first: Rest In Peace Uncle Phil, for real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'mma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
Talk to a nigga...

One time for my LA sisters
One time for my LA hoes

[Verse 1]
No role models and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory
My memory, I couldn't find one
Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
By the baddest bitch; not Trina, but I swear to God
This bitch'll make you call your girl up and tell her
"Hey, what's good?"
"Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'mma stay for good"
Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
You wasn't sweatin' me

One time for my LA sisters

Lame niggas can't tell the difference

I want a real love, dark skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood, bringin' back 5 or 6 hoes
Fuck em then we kick em to the do', nigga you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap, she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt
'Fore she leave—I'mma need my shirt back
Nigga you know how it go

One time for my LA sisters

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas—probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once—shame on—shame on you. Fool me — you can't get fooled again

[Bridge]
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you
Fool me one time, shame on you
Fool me twice, can't put the blame on you
Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you

[Verse 3]
My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script the bitch probably couldn't read along
My only regret was too young for Sade Adu
My only regret could never take Aaliyah home
Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face cause they know it's they song
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)
She shallow, but the pussy deep (she shallow, she shallow)

Took a trip to clear my mind
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oooh
Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
Me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far

What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy Majin Buu, oh oh
Close my eyes and fall into you
My god she’s giving me pleasure

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy Majin Buu,  oh oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My god giving me pleasure
Pleasure pleasure pleasure
Pleasure over matter

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job"
I didn’t wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far’s too close and I remember
My memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I’m building y’all a clock, stop
What am I Hemingway?
She had the kind of body
That would probably intimidate
Any of ‘em that were un-southern
Not me cousin
If models are made for modelin'
Thick girls are made for cuddlin’
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend?
I need to hold your hand
You’d need no other man
We’d flee to other lands

Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

You’re good at being bad
You’re bad at being good

Nah knock on wood
You’re good at being bad
You’re bad at being good
For heaven’s sakes go to hell
Knock knock knock knock on wood

Make her swab the mu'fucking wood
Make her walk the mu'fucking plank
Make her rob a mu'fucking bank

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1]
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
I hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he felt today
You know, when you part of Section.80
And you feel like no one can relate
‘Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party, trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with a 808 (A melody and some hoes)
Playstation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see
Is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head
Then she look at me, she got A.D.H.D

And then she started…
And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon?" "Oh, I rap, baby."
"How old are you?", She say 22, I say 23
"Okay, then we are crack babies."
"Damn, why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later
Just tell your neighbors that the police relaxed."
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen; Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside
Then she said, "Read between the lines."
Yep, hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown
Her body and I know
The both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me, then looked at it
Then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood."
"You know why we crack babies?
Because we born in the '80s, that A.D.H.D. crazy."

Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Verse 1]
I done came down, hold up
Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not
I'm G'd up, East up
Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

[Hook]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Verse 2]
I done came down, came up
Slow pitch, change up
Same hood, same style, same drink, same cup
She call me when she wanna fuck
I never call, she knows what's up
Same page, same book, different song, same hook
Everytime her nigga trippin', she on the phone with the same crook
And everytime I pull up, she hit me with that same look
Lips bitin', hips right
She left her man for that get right
I'm in the middle, like midnight
Only if you got that sit tight
Only if you got that wine fine
Only if you got that sip type
Only if you got that mind bomb
Only if you got that zip tight
Eat that shit like wonton
Jokin' baby, I'm pimp tight
I'm used to bein' that one and done
But girl you got that g-get right

[Hook]

[Outro]

I came down, hold up, hold up, I said hold up
Hold up, I done came down like hold up
Hold up, hold up, fuck, 'chea

[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah...
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right...
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high...
Well maybe a little, baby I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01,  my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screening out the lane
Went from "Damn this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me, no, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble (think about it)
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble (gone)

[Pre-Hook: Migos]
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Gang bang slang caine
Heroin, half a ton, Purple Haze, Cam'ron
Plays off a Samsung, get the job done
If I go jog at night, yeah, call it a mall run
You know what I did last night, cause I gave her all ones
You niggas in trouble, rock chains by the double
Got dames by the double, do everything but cuddle
Might buy a bowling alley, I got money out the gutter
Fully automatic, and it don't don't stutter (rra!)

[Pre-Hook: Migos]
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Hop out the bed and I'm countin' them faces
I jump out the whip and them bitches start faintin'
No twenties or fifties, just Benjamin Franklins
Block on lock call me Kurt Angle
I keep the bag on my brother, my partner
Don't fuck with no strangers, they tryna' get famous
I put the hood on my back
When these niggas couldn't do nothing but love it
But these niggas still hated
No they ain't real but these niggas gonna fake it
If they got a problem my niggas gon' strain it
Niggas debatin', they hating', they plottin', they waitin'
They want my ice tell em come take it
Have em pretend that I couldn't make it
Now I'm doin shows outta state in the nations
My momma told me stay humble don't be too ready
You gotta have patience

[Verse 4: Offset]
Droppin' them bangers, bangers, bangers
Double cup stuffed full Texas Ranger
One in the chamber
I shoot a hundred round clip like Wilt Chamberlain
Go to the top and I'm gon' bring the gang in
Bitch, do anything to get famous
My wrist cost me a brick and it's frigid
I'm rich, but I did not let it change me
Statistics say that you niggas ain't gangsta

[Pre-Hook: Migos]
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Camila Cabello]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Intro: Swae Lee & Gucci Mane]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive ‘em
But you said you didn't need 'em

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Most of these dudes is really quite soft

'Bout to drop a album, this is my fourth
I don't put sugar in my spaghetti sauce
Drop a freestyle and get these hoes parched
Fire burn the obea man church
Pretty girls, when my girls get right
'Cause it's another day, let ya light shine bright
Ain't none of them in your lane
True mi have di game pon lock, dem wah code
Just link wit some hot gyal out ah road
True mi have di waist small, pretty, bus whine
Rolex nah deh pon uno dutty gyal time?
Yo, I told 'em pull up on me faster than Danica
That's on the low I'm tryna blow him like harmonicas
He call me queen, he know "Nicki" is the moniker
He want a mix between Hillary and Monica
I switch it up, I switch it up
Rip the beat, then I, I stitch it up

You probably got your hands full, whatever goal you pursue
All this pain, we can live through it, it's called success

You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I won't ask the bitch unless she going to get it
It might take a minute, but she'll be sure to get it
Just to pass the test, I won't act the best
I got Actavis, there's nothing I can't ask the bitch, no
Got one missed, no missed calls, hell nah, nah
She got a man, can't get involved, nah nah
She still going all ways every time I call
We gonna ball today, we gonna ball tomorrow
I put this weight on like I put a cape on
Now that this fame came, I can see the hate on you
Mama told me stay strong, grandma told me stay on
Now she looking down, throwing blessings

You go out your way and keep cool
You go out your way and break rules
You go out your way, so out your way
You're going out your way, you can't lose
Vacate, trips to Cancun, spaceship trips to the moon
Never likes to tell the truth
Head full of hair, but the cat well groomed
Plan a trip to Peru, charter jet, me and you
You going out your way, way out your way
So I had to do this for you
Jackpot, hit the right spot, so she had to get a tattoo
It's some dirt and hurt, but ain't perfect
If she going our way, come through
Hold me down, either good or bad
Never switch, or act brand new
You go out your way and wasn't told to
So I made this song just for you

But you had my back from the other me
She bending over, back for me
Made a deal that you wouldn't cross, lie to me
It was so many people that doubted me
Shit talk, shit talk, bullets starting to let off

Blast off, blast off, my career gon' blast off
We don't need y'all, want y'all, we don't have to ask y'all

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can't provide for ya
Whenever you around I seen it come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

[Hook]
Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one
Savage I ain't even hatin'"
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
"Savage I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape"
Yeah, nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

[Hook]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 2]
So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

[Hook]
Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Outro]
So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt

[Intro]
Yo, bro, I think I had too much Hennessy, man
This Hennessy gettin' to me
I ain't gonna lie, I'm a little smizz
I'm a little drizz
But we in the club, man, OOOUUU

[Verse]
Yeah, they hate, but they broke though
And when it's time to pop they a no-show
Yeah, I'm pretty, but I'm loco
The loud got me movin' slow-mo
Ayo, Tweetie, where the hoes, bro?
Ayo, Keys, where the hoes though?
That other nigga, he a bozo
It's M.A, you don't know, ho?
We got liquor by the boatload (that Henny)
Disrespect the Lyfe, that's a no-no
All my niggas dressed in that rojo (Redlyfe)
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code
Baby gave me head; that's a low blow
Damn, she make me weak when she deep throat
I need a rich bitch, not a cheap ho
They be on that hate shit, I peep though
My brother told me: "Fuck 'em, get that money, sis!"
You just keep on grindin' on your hungry shit
Ignore the hate, ignore the fake, ignore the funny shit
‘Cause if a nigga violate, we got a hunnit clips (grrrrrrrah!)
And we go zero to a hundred quick (ooouuu)
We just them niggas you ain't fuckin' with (oh no)
Pockets on a chubby chick (ah)
And still go bag a thottie in some bummy shit (ooouuu)
Yerr, Eli, why they testin' me?
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame
If that's your chick, then why she textin' me?
Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?
Every time I'm out, why she stressin' me?
You call her Stephanie? I call her Headphanie (OOOUUU)
I don't open doors for a whore
I just want the neck, nothin' more
Shawty, make it clap, make it applaud!
When you tired of your man, give me a call
Dyke bitches talking out they jaw
Next minute, calling for the law
This 9 will have 'em calling for the Lord
They ain't getting shmoney, so they bored
I could never lose, what you thought?
M.A got it on lock, man, of course
They say I got the juice, I got the sauce
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
Pussy, I'm a bully and a boss
I'm killing 'em, sorry for your loss (R.I.P.)
I just caught a body; Randy Moss
Now this year I'm really going off

[Outro]
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
Ah, these haters on my body, shake 'em off
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
I could never lose, what you thought?
What they thought?
I could never lose, what you thought?
This Henny got me, it got me sauced
This Henny got me, oh, it got me sauced
I could never lose, what you thought?
M.A got it on lock, man, of course
OOOUUU, OOOUUU

[Intro]
Ye, Belair nero
è la storia
Una storia come tante
Trankilo fra'

[Hook: Vegas Jones]
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Come scorre un fiume di parole
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto

[Verse 1: Vegas Jones]
Fuori è chiaro anche se è notte e ci sarà la neve
Io me ne sarò andato svelto senza dire niente
Nelle orecchie non ho più il suono delle sirene
Tira piano, il fumo passa dalle tapparelle
Non discuto con l'agente, vuole informazioni
Io non sono l'anagrafe, non li faccio i nomi
Prego il cielo mentre fumo, vedo arcobaleni
Infatti Dio sa che ne ho combinate di tutti i colori
E so che...
No, non è domenica
Ma tutti i miei sognano una domenica da Dio
Quasi meritata dopo anni passati nell'oblio
Ma tu che ne sai di interni di plastica di una Clio?
Sento plastica nelle cose che dicono
Io ci salto i pasti per le cose che ti dico mo'
Farai sempre male a non fidarti di un amico
Ad affidarti a dei bastardi a cui non piaci di principio
Quindi sai che se...

[Bridge: Vegas Jones]
Parlo solo di soldi perché i miei drammi più grandi
Non ho nemmeno coraggio di raccontarli
Tieni sempre gli occhi aperti quando giri gli angoli
Il destino è li che tira i fili, vuole che ti strangoli
Non dare corda a questi visi pallidi e stanchi
La partita la perdi quando sei al pari degli altri
Perderanno i tuoi nemici col passare degli anni
Io perdono i miei nemici, servirà a depistarli

[Hook: Vegas Jones] [x2]
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Come scorre un fiume di parole
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto

[Verse 2: Nitro]
Ho fatto un disco d'oro con un disco d'odio
Vedi il vuoto nel mio sguardo fisso perché ambisco al podio
Tu vuoi solo il tête-à-tête, lo capisco al volo
Vorrei darti il vecchio me ma preferisco il nuovo
E sono stanco ormai di correre
Di pensare che ogni bastardo mi voglia fottere
In parole povere
Son stanco di vedere che ti parlo e non mi stai ascoltando
Ma aspettando per rispondere
Che cazzo...
Mi aspetta una staffetta illimitata
Ma so già che la mia vetta è meritata
Di notte vedo mostri con la faccia ribaltata
La vendetta privata
In una cassetta piratata
Poi la luce si fa fioca, la pupilla dilatata
Per i soldi, per la droga e per la vita dilaniata
Vorrei che tu vedessi con che faccia disperata
Mi guarda mia mamma quando me ne vado via di casa
Fanculo!
Quando ci si guarda dentro, qui non ride più nessuno
E devo stare attento
Per uscire in tempo da questo tunnel buio
Perché mi hanno detto che pensare uccide più del fumo
E non pensare che non sia sensibile
Ma me ne frego di quello che credi sia credibile
Ti sei mai chiesto quanto sia difficile decidere se
Vivere per scrivere o se scrivere per vivere?
Ma l'uomo è un animale e devi urlare più forte
Se non vuoi diventare il suo giullare di corte
Per imparare qui devi sbagliare un quintale di volte
E provare ad andare oltre
Tu non ragionare ad onde corte
Non si può spiegare, nonsense
Senza allungare gambe corte
Raddrizzare piante storte
Anteporre il male e ignorare quanto sangue scorre

[Bridge: Nitro]
La mia vita è un cortometraggio, racconto di un saggio
Dove il protagonista sembra morto nel viaggio
Ti ho già perso di vista
Mentre affondo tra il fango, il rimorso, il rimpianto
Ogni giorno m'incazzo
Pur di non tenere addosso il volto del falso
È un problema grosso e non hai colto il messaggio
Se crollo mi rialzo e mi prendo sto mondo del cazzo
Se è vero che...

[Hook: Vegas Jones] [x2]
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Come scorre un fiume di parole
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto

[Intro]
Ronny J, listen up

[Hook]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

[Verse 1]
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate
Hey, young boy had to penetrate
Face, young boy done caught a case
Bang, now his mama living with the pain
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay
Let him get the senzu bean so he regenerate
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state
Denzel Curry is the new candidate
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus
Bitches be bopping it, bow down and pop it in
Dropping it in her esophagus
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it
Girl, I can make you a star
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist
Ripping through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm living so harmonious
Feeling like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics, bitch, I'm ultimate
Ultimate, bitch I'm

[Hook]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, is he fake, is he real
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Dropping melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fucking with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches looking thirsty
Riding through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story

[Hook]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

[Intro]
This is called being high as shit, for hours
That's the name of this song, nigga
"High as Shit for Hours"
Here we go, yeah

[Verse 1]
American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
They came here seekin' freedom
Then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second, watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's "Fuck the government!"
They see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 2]
I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him
Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke
Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout
As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down and showed me he was well-aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up?
He said, "There's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit, nigga: politics."
Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight, third verse)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 3]
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See, the people at the top, they get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla "Revolution!"
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played
Then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution
Dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said, what good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna (High for hours, nigga)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go (Volume one)
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse]
Look, give me the ball and I will have to pass it
I ain't passing out until I'm asthma attacking
I take a plan and then I back-to-back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, oh, ways, away

[Outro]
Look, I'm a Don, I'm a Don, I'm a Don (Don)
I gave my whole family jobs and I take care of my Mom
Me and my girl been through so much, that's my partner in crime
Touch any of the above, now you're harder to find
Gone

[Hook: Dave]
I changed my number couple times cuh' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster

[Verse 1: J Hus]
Quickly stop off at the off-licence
Bossman, let me get a two two drink
Gyaldem ah' watch my 'ting
How 'bout a crook and a princess combining
And I've been givin' gyal the good pipe
And man walked in, yo, it's not what it looks like
Give man high five, kiss her goodnight
I'm in your eyesight
But I'm not your type, I'm more like your life
Keep quiet, I'm preaching
Put a sock in it, put a sock on the fire alarm
Fingers lookin' like a fire arm
Well I spit this fire
Plus I came with the fire
Um, what's that ting with the silencer?
Man come through and silence 'em
I was never the cool kid
More like strange and awkward
Biscuit for your forehead
Tore my forearms exhausted
I been road my fortress
Spent four months in the forefront
We party for a fortnight
But I was too weak by the fourth night

[Hook: Dave]
I changed my number couple times cuh' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster
I changed my number couple times cuh' man kept callin' me for things
And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera
Might just link Samantha
Mix the gentleman with gangster

[Verse 2: Dave]
We are not Gs, I am not from your ends
I don't give a fuck what you done
Two young Gs, arms out, nobody move, you can get stuck in the mud
We sent your man to the shop
What do you mean? He ain't ever made it rain
Your man is a fraud, your boyfriend's livin' a lie
You're kinda like Rachel Zane
I'm gentle when it comes to the girl dem
But I'm gangster with some voddy and voss
My girl don't wanna stop for a chat
Then I'm onto her friends like Joey and Ross
Babe, what you mean you can't talk for a sec?
It's calm, you don't even know what you lost
Stone Island from my head to my feet
When I step on the street, I dunno what it cost, but
I know it's expensive
She told me she love me but really I don't even know if she meant it
And if feds pull this whip, that's numerous offences
Why you gassed off a rack?
I put three on my dentins, I put three on my dentins

[Bridge: J Hus]
Close your eyes, it might be blinding
And they wonder why I'm smiling
Until I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing
Close your eyes, it might be blinding
And they wonder why I'm smiling
Until I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing

[Hook: Dave]

[Intro: Southside & Future]
Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies
I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings
So let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its
And it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister
Guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all red drop tarantula
Fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh
Where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up
Hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck
You're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge
Try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin
When she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig
But you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig?
You grew up with me

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Mike Will Made It Nigga
Sremm Life
Black Barbies in the city
Fat ass and pretty titties
Get dummies for they money
You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive ’em
All your lies I wish I didn't believe 'em

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots, shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
New things for them to imitate
I'm a fuckin' black barbie
Pretty face, perfect body
Pink seats in the 'Rari
Always fuck him like I'm sorry
Who the fuck is gon’ protect her?
If I really gotta check her
Peter Piper picked a pepper
And my cake is triple decker

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I see these silly nigga’s flexin', it’s a no zone
You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers like you know Joan
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone
She said she got a hit record, I said "Oooh shit!"
Picked up my phone cause I had to call "Bullshit!"
These bitches havin’ nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit
Hahaha, get it? Douche-...hahahahahahaha
Half a mili on the Maybach Pullman, bought it
Now I'm prayin'  all my foreigns don't get deported
Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts
And these clown niggas actin', I'mma send 'em some skits
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus
Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw but none of them Cartoonists
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess
And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid
Go against the queen your career will be elusive
Where your plaques at? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax-brack
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Good drank, big knots
Good drugs, I put a four on the rocks (lean!)

Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 1]
Ay, Lil Kodak on the beat I got that bass, ho
Boy I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Beamer but I'm about to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ainna
She know a nigga be stunting like a Power Ranger

These ain't Ray-bans, these Saint Laurent shades, ho
The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ay, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

Next nigga to fuck with me, gon' be stuck with me with his stuck ass. Bitch. Watch, look. Hold up, l-l-look, no time. Okay?

[Intro]
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I

[Verse 1]
Up for hours drinking
Posted up, just reflecting on it
And I know you won't believe me
But babe, I'm cold and yeah, this life is cold
I say swear you won't come near me
Keep your heart cause I could fuck you up
Or have you never thinking clearly, never thinking clearly
Have you all up in your feelings
Experienced, I did it times before
And I can see you from a distance
I could fuck you now and years later on
You gon' be stuck, just reminiscing
It's the way I ride you, let you stay inside
Yeah, I'ma fuck you like a vixen
There's something 'bout me

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear you see the good in me
But that don't beat the hood in me
And I got my intentions and use
Guess I'm make believe
Cause baby I know, baby, I know

[Chorus]
I—I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I—I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

[Verse 2]
Up for days, been rolling
Sweating bullets, don't regret the choices
That I made 'cause I'm still growing
Sign the deal and then they cut the check
And ever since, my color's showing
Change the scene, the things are better now
And you know the wave is never slowing
The wave is never slowing
I know that you will miss me
You liked it when I used to leave a wound
And promise I would come and kiss it
I fed you lies and you just ate 'em up
And I don't care to do the dishes
I ain't no wifey, ain't gon' hold you down
It's way more fun to be the mistress
I know I'm not like other bitches

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear you see the good in me
But that don't beat the hood in me
And I got my intentions and use
Guess I'm make believe 'cause baby, I know, baby, I know

[Chorus]
I—I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I—I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

[Bridge]
You want all my time
But I don't got enough
Baby, I can put it down
But I can't put it up
I got too much time to live
Well I'm still way too young
I'm still way too young, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma do you dirty
I—I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I—I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

[Hook]
These niggas prayed on my downfall
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse 1]
Go get the thermometer for the pot
I need this shit cooked right
Lets keep this water four hundred degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Being broke did something to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, driving German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, remember I used to use your L's to hit the road
Hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, remember when you had them green things mailed with vacuum seals
Trying not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money
I don't know nothing, I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you everyday before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers coming in and out of court
Aye Won though, aye Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle

[Beat change]

[Verse 2]
Aye JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down
Pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill you
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas hoe me, quit being silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doing better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gone drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, get ahead of them niggas
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends happy, bling dancing, eating sixty dollar salad
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fucking shoulders (Boom boom boom!)
You hear me? hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? a Jag Portfolio
You hear me? aye I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feeling hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the hoe in niggas
Free my nigga Perico, that boy be hoeing niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy I can't trust you with that strap if you don't got no bodies
Boy I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think I was coming home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cumming on
Get em to the crib, bust em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shaking like there's something wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch I came home to my lil brother gone
Niggas say they looking for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fucking, put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds trying to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch I'm two and oh
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here
They don't know what he on

[Hook]
I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall
On all ten bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's party, party, party like a nigga just got out of jail
Flyin' in my 'rari like a bat that just flew outta hell
I'm from the east of ATL, but ballin' in the Cali hills
Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still
I'm tryna fuck, who tryna chill? 'Cause I'm just tryna pay some bills
I'm multi millionare LaFlare, this watch here cost a quarter M
Just look at me and look at them, I smashed her on my first attempt
Like Scarface bitch, the world is mine, you should read the blimp
So either you gon' take a ride, or you gon' stay with him
'Cause I got places I can be, I get yo ass on the scene
Gucci, CB VIP, so fuck them niggas, look at me, Wop

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Pull up on your bitch, tell your man I'm sorry
Hundred on my wrist, jumpin' out the 'rari
Ooh, she hit the splits, she know how to party

How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party
How to party, yeah, we know how to party

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy
I'm watchin' Freaks and Geeks
With the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna' cop the new McLaren
With the vertical doors, nigga

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Money, money, money, money
Money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not impo'tant
I'm focused
(2, 3, 4)
Bring in the horns
They say I'm nutty
I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich
I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkin's a faggot
Please come and get me
Said I suck him at your neck
Like a hickey
Boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim
Ain't nobody fuckin' wit me
I got banned from New Zealand
Whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, goddammit
I couldn't believe in it
Ban a kid from a country
I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent
Your child idol's a nigga
I clearly don't give a fuck
So you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack
And fuck your Snapchat
Cherry Bomb
The greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon pop
Just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, bout to drop
Gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick
Hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth
Call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, cause I'm raisin' the stakes
Mom I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
When we ate its the steaks, now our section is great
Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass 'em a plate
'Ye!

[Break: Kanye West]
Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me?
Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
But I feel like Michael Jordan
Scottie Pippen at my weddin'
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't Lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer takin a bite or somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me "Are you still down?"
Yeah, my nigga, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they tell they white daughters
"Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga archetype
I am the light and the beacon
You can ask the deacon
It's funny, when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck, hold up
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level
Had a drink with Fear, and I was textin' God
He said, "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"

[Hook 2: Tyler, The Creator]
For your boy
I'm tryna' cop the new McLaren
With the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks
Got a trampoline in my room, damn

[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
(2, 3, 4)
Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it

Been exhausted

While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin losers

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Hold your fuckin' ponies my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely

Yo, what up Wayne?

'Nother nigga like I, you won't find one
Cuz nigga I'm a god, a divine one
Tune

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
My trigger finger wise
But my 9 dumb (yeah)
Middle finger blind
So it's fuck A-N-Y-one
Fuck, skate, and die son
A hundred ways to die son
I'm starin' at a tramp-on-lean
Make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks
Wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rolie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda
Oh my goodness

[Verse 7: Tyler, the Creator]
Wayne, them bitches ugly
These niggas colder than Tommy' buddy
Ye, we hittin' models
Like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel

They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling
Boy, lets get a scrimmage
And cut some niggas
I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German
You bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow
And get bodies burnin
Cause I'm tryna' hang like I'm Mr. Cooper
Or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon, was
Fuck us
Maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys
Cuz I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot, uhh..

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne]
Son you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset, to go on tour with Yeezus
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef
Like zucchini
I know; it ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange

Nah faggot, it's Golf Wang

Why all these rap niggas wanna be bloods?
Never see them in the hood only see them in the club
Ask Snaz I snuck in with the snub, and I just left the block
Had the homies say I'm dumb
What's up with that, shit
Nigga I don't fuck with that, shit
I'm 'bout to pull a Suge Knight and press the issue on sight
The real bloods either get a check or we own your ass
I went to sleep flamed up but I woke up in my Polos
I rock a low cut and wear my socks like a cholo
I coulda got a Ghost but I went and got a Lo-Lo
Cause copying off you rap niggas is a no no
I can hop out solo, tucked is a 4-4
I probably need three more, cause these niggas is emo
And see my altitude, they have an attitude
But I'm a solid ass nigga, what you niggas mad at me for?

Got hit in the hip, couldn't pop back
Pass me y'all Buddha strap
You know we pop that, so please
Don't call me no rap nigga (Why?)
Cause I be in the spot strapped nigga
All facts nigga, I don't wax nigga
You put Compton, I put Bompton on the map nigga

Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say "What's up?" to me
Okay, so now you wanna make love to me

[Hook]
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry, you not the one for me

[Verse 2]
Just be honest, girl, what you want from me?
This ain't nothin' new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by God-Tiller, you better run from me
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers goin' up, I feel a buzz comin' (one up)

Lookin' for a bad bitch, I finally found a culprit
Nigga takin' shots, send 'em back, check the postage, yeah
Hatin' ass nigga, why won't you shut up?
This the motherfuckin' 502 come up

Every bitch with a hidden agenda run up (cause I'm on, nigga!)

Every nigga did you wrong, except for me
I'm next to blow and so you should've been next to me
Say you lovesick, girl I got the remedy
I'll give you long dick and longevity
Don't settle for less or for infidelity
Niggas ain't built like me
He can't bag and pipe and leave that pussy killed like me
Or even keep the business behind his lips like me
I got a hundred fuckin' problems
Good brain, am I fuckin' with a scholar?
Woodgrain, I'ma grip it when I whip it
If I take a shot and brick it, I'ma flip it
Thankful for my papa, nigga taught me how to get it
Gotta make sure my brothers is eating, I'ma split it
If she throw that pussy at me I'ma hit it
Pen Griffey, but she won't get a penny, no

I love the hood with my whole heart
It whole heartedly been a part of me in my own thought process
So I digest through my own art
That I'm blessed though I digress due to slow starts
But who else could bring the hood out
And tell 'em when they let God in, it brings the good out
Learn a lesson and listen
My current composition concerns your present condition
And turn direction envision of givin' blessings and wishin' you well
Well wishing and tales fishing
Siftin' through hell's kitchen to find good
Have a God-like mind as the divine should
Define good within yourself I think the time's good
And may these lines live forever like a line should
It's a war going on and your soul fighting
So frightening within you I see thunder and both lightening
Boat striking, snow ice and hail
Your whole life unfold like, cold nights in Hell
In a mode like, you're feeling low like, like you don't like yourself
You got no sight, no insight
No foresight, that's the shit that your foes like
Run up on a nigga get 'em froze like
Put the 4-4 to his foes like
Niggas 'bout to take a pic, trying to get the pose right
Red dot, headshot, hit 'em close like
Like, like all theses niggas I've got to shoot one
Fuck one pistol I'm cocking two guns
Fuck shoe money, I'm coppin' coupes son
No y'all niggas not 'bout to do none
Guns, that's a way of life, get money not God
You got guns, we got bigger guns, go get one and I ride
If I die, they say I went hard, I go super hard
Bitch you with this shits or not? We gon' get this loot or starve?
Fuck you doing? Writin' in a pad, fuck you making songs
What you rappin', boy you know what's happ'nin', that shit take too long
Fuck you mean? Get this fucking cream, get this fucking cream
Hug this block, tote this fucking Glock, can't let these suckers scheme
Shit too real, shit too fucking real, I'm too real to dream
So when it's -- [gunshots] --this cold world won't feel a thing

[Outro: Marhsa Ambrosius]
Lonely days are gone
All them nights to come
Waited to be yours
So let's make love not war
So let the choir sing and let 'em know
So let the choir sing and let 'em know
So let the choir sing and let 'em know
Whoa...

[Verse 1]
Chef Sweaty braising your faculty
Face getting gray from the ash, but I'm laughing
That's the trace in me, nigga
Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute
My days numbered
I'm focused heavy on making the most of 'em
I feel like I'm the only one pressin' to grow upwards
It's still fuck you and whoever you showed up with
Trying to see an M and some some steadier hands
Who you callin' your mans?
Bet you thought he was solid, when he really just sand
Washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August in the wake of that August
Last autumn the leaves fell, and I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribe, faith never caught 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in a faucet

[Chorus]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me

[Verse 2]
Solid, so the funds don't phase me
On tour wildin' by the truck stop racists
Hard as finding me a, a common thread between us
Raised different, my momma, she born, bred the leader
To get shit poppin' like the gun's off safety
Sayin' easy and doing harder when you get caught up
Raised neck and neck with Nak, so I’m a fluent brawler
Rain checkin’ on ya plot if ever bread should pop up
Out the toaster I gotta focus, my family problems
Shrunk and widen with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in
Or reverse to the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket
Shit in a pile, never change, I’m stupid for tryin’
Still just too busy wildin’

[Chorus]
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me
And I don't know who house to call home lately
I hope my phone break, let it ring
Toe to toe with the foes, new and old
Basic hoes try to cage him like the po'
When I run, don't chase me

Been spent your rent and I'm still blowing big faces
Something 'bout them Ben Franklins make any bitch get naked
Crew got the juice, bitch you don't need no chasers
Ball on these niggas, I need knee replacements

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]
Sipping out the jug until I feel it in my body
I was, uh, hoping you were salty when you saw me
Keep a rowdy scene around me, all we do is dip and dab
Got twin turbos on twin turbos and them bitches really smash
It's a 50/50 chance I might ditch ya (ditch ya)
It's a 50/50 chance that these niggas didn't pitch in
I'm pouring up 'til I can't no more
I swear everything I see slow mo

Ooh I don't need y'all either
Ooh don't wanna talk about it
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody
I guess I don't
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
She gon' be mad right? Ain't that too bad, right?
Wanna catch that cab, right? Take back that bag, right?
I guess that she just gon' go buy herself that purse, that purse
I guess that she just gon' go swipe, buy her self worth, that’s cold
Now I'm the villain, nah really I'm just chillin'
Tryna stack these 20s, 50s, hundreds, millions, to the ceilin'
Mary, Mary all I need, pussy, money, weed
And all my women in doubles, I'm at the DoubleTree
All I hear hoes callin' out wildin', on the road like every day
We everywhere, any day and anywhere that the money say
No questions, no questions please, just on your knees
Blow, don't sneeze, bitch shut up, don't breathe
Gasp, on the gas, 'til I crash, autopsy said that nigga mashed
All praise to Allah, not Ramadan but these bitches fast
Fuck in the party, pull up her skirt, then skrrr
Who her? I forgot her name

[Hook: Vic Mensa & Kanye West]
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
There go another lawsuit
In court so much, man I should've went to law school
Everybody brawlin', it was all cool
'Til I hit the bartender with the barstool
I don't fuck with fake dudes wearin' fake Trues
I just talked to 2 Chainz and he said, "TRUUU!"
I feel like MJ, I'm in his shoes
I'm talkin' Montell Jordan, this is how we do
Bust a nigga head and then I lay low
These niggas ass-water, get the Drano
She ain't really bad, she a photo thot
I should hire this bitch, she so damn good at Photoshop
That Lexapro got me drowsy, then a heart attack
I think they finally think got me where they want me at
I got 700 emails in my inbox
What that mean? I ain't callin' nobody back

[Hook: Vic Mensa & Kanye West]
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody

Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
I be catchin' too many stares this evening
God fearin' but God knows I'm on a roll
At the Louvre in Paris, still be on the block like the corner store
Ain't my fault you ain't the man, made a plan, man it was planned
They sleeping on me like long flights, I pop a Xan on the way to France
Paparazzi like, "Oh that's him!", pour that gin, let's get faded
Drinkin' like it's no tomorrow, what's today? I'm in the Matrix
Hater, please let me live my life, swear to God I be tryna do right
But if she bad I might hit a bitch in the elevator like Ray Rice
Uh, y'all pay the price, I pay the difference, it's just different
SAVEMONEY, ain't nothin' different, gunshots and jumpin' fences
Hold on, I'm tryna get loose, please don't get shit confused
Ask Don C, I've been lit, this 'Ye shit just lit the fuse
Now I'm on fire, everybody go quiet
Like where was you last week? My nigga the fuck was you hidin'?
Like I was laying on my arm, I'm on my side
South side, I'm down to start a riot

[Hook: Vic Mensa & Kanye West]
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like I don't, like I don't know nobody
Ooh like, ooh like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody, like I don't know nobody
Oh you mad, huh?

Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

Bitch you know you can't parallel park anyway

[Hook]
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright

[Verse 1]
Back when my brother sold crack and my sister was a real one
Always was a real one
Saw you workin' early, tell me how you feel, huh?
Baby what's your hurry, get it how you live, huh?
Baby what's your name?, I've been goin' through a lot
I can't do this on my own, got no place to go Rashad
And that's a long way
Hey they gone love you when you're hot
They won't miss you when you gone if you're looking for a spot
That's the wrong one

[Hook]
But we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gon' play you out
Alright, alright, alright

Alright, alright, alright

[Verse 2]
Back when my sister sold hair
Heard you lookin' for the deal huh, get it how you live huh
Damn you caught me splurgin', lookin' for the real ones
If I make it early, get it for the little ones
I can see your pain, hope my voice is helping out
Hope your momma workin' out, she won't even come out the house
Heard she had a surgery, granny died before the drop
I don't like to visit home, I don't like to see the drought
Call me when you steppin' out, I might bring the cup with me
I might play the "Back and Forth", on my '94 Aali
We can split a O or three, this is how it's supposed to be
Like we had a better trial, fuck the jury, fuck with me

[Hook]
We on our own huh, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song
I'm not no number one
Cause they gone do you wrong, and they gone play you out
Alright
We can't be no number one, but we can be the jam
Cause what these niggas on, is not my favorite song

[Intro - Mick Jenkins]
Still drinkin' water on y'all niggas, man

[Verse - Mick Jenkins]
With perfect pitch I'm singing free my niggas
Polished and purposeful he's producing pristine pictures
Pay me, gimme plenty, the trees begat keys
That's paper, so hold the pennies
I'm pressed and like pests, I'm in every nook and cranny
Your pantry, with some patience your panties
I got patience, it's prevalent in the previous plannings
I been on my P's and Q's, fuck is this? A Quiz?
Peep this nigga passion, I'm not picking him to quit
Watch him paint, ain't it quaint?
All that presence in his pen, he be pearlin' all that wisdom, all that pressure be to sin
A pearlescent silver lining through the questions I been quilting together
Niggas quiver in the cold, are you equipped for the weather?
When there's polar and it's piercing through your sweater to your chest
How you persevere and press on through the quest?
I been on my P's and Q's, can't you see I do not play?
And I pack it full of quotes
Pray you perceive it in the way that I intended
I ain't preaching and I'm never that pretentious
Not pretending, Quasimodo how my back is
I've been bending, I've been lifting all the pounds
Break it down, pass it around
Politicking with my peoples' then my partner, them my rounds
Quality is what we seek, I'm not playing 'til we peak
Quintessential to survival is the cunnin' to compete
You picked defeat, if your efforts will only ever be passive aggressive
Be my pleasure to let it fly like attached to propellers
And compel all your people to say your prayer in your passin'
Man fuck the gassin', I'm too persistent, and what could they tell us, huh?
I been on my P's and Q's, quantum leaps ahead of my peers
They not even in my peripheral, pray I keep it proper
Cause they play it so political, the petty is so pitiful
Niggas Peter Pettigrew, I'm of a higher pedigree
I'm peddling this penmanship, appreciate the pleasantries, but
It's quiet for y'all niggas
I mean, you know I've been on point with it
Ain't even gotta smoke a joint
I'm getting high off the feel, y'all just trying to make some coins with it
Educate my loins
You've been gifted like I pearled a couple poinsettias
On my P's and Q's
Quarantine the phrase, you could comprehend it better, bring phonetics into play, I'm no pharaoh
Message never mystical
Breath of antihistamine, I'm trying to heal the physical
Requiring a pivotal stance
For my mans niggas, know I'm not dolo
Provide you with the proof, it's never quid pro quo tho
It's Free Nation, please no photos
Yeah, power to the people, middle finger to the popo

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, gold crown, top down as I cruise with a bad ho
Yeah, I-9, from Chicago

I got a line on the five pack
A hundred thangs on the scale, motherfucker, can you buy that?
She pop that pussy and rewind that
And suck a dick as I get twisted and listen to Do or Die rap
Freddie Kane, young Corleone
Hoppin' out the van wit' the bows of the strong
Nigga gettin' paid from the shit that I record
Here, My Lord, wit' the pack when a nigga came home
Told my nigga we be smokin' and chokin', rollin', it's all the same
Druggin' and still thuggin', it's all a game
Real nigga 'bout to cash out
I need my rims on my cars when I pull them bitches off the lot
Fuck the top, cop the drop
And these hoes be on my jock, for my hot
Car and watch, but this pimpin' never stop
Tired or not, what you thought?
And this paper turn 'em out
What she 'bout? Ain't no doubt

[Hook]
Thank God I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot

[Verse 2]
Yeah, gold crown, top down as I cruise with a bad ho
Yeah, I-5, on the West Coast
And I done been around the world
But in Cali, they blow the best dope
Bitches and palm trees, I'm on when I came here
Plug was up north, I pushed to the yay then
Shout-out my niggas, I got a ton when the weight in
Feedin' my thugs, I'm pullin' dubs in the state pen
Fuckin' with Frederico Soprano
Niggas actin' monkey, my clip, I got a banana
Rollin' with guerillas, these niggas don't want no banter
I just might go flippin', go back and forth with them hammers
Nigga, we be smokin' and chokin', rollin', it's all the same
Druggin' and still thuggin', it's all a game
Full clip on the K thang
I got a shotty in the motherfuckin' trunk, nigga, don't get popped
Fuck the cops, bodies drop
And these feds be on my block, round the clock, stop and watch
But this thuggin' never stop
Get that rock, what you thought?
And these haters talk a lot, ain't gon' pop a hundred shots

[Hook]
Thank God I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot
And you know I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot
And these hoes, I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot
Pesos, I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot
Thank God I got a…
And I don't mean to be so careless, baby, eh
One thing on my mind, it's the way I came up
So don't catch no feelings
Girl, you playin' wit' the motherfuckin' realest

I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot
These hoes, I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot
Pesos, I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot
And she know I got a lot, I got a lot, I got a lot

[Intro]
I don't wanna hear at that, I don't wanna hear none of that
Talkin' to cameras like "What you need?" and all that shit
Fuck that shit, I don't remember none of that shit

[Hook 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, you went and switched sides?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas spread lies on him?
Where your ass was at, dog, when the bodies came sliding?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was serving pies?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was in the Pyrex?
Where your ass was at, dog, when I was drinking Hi-Tech?
Where your ass was at, dog? Came through the projects
Where your ass at? We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick, ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis, put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the 'gram, now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt, Amoco

[Hook 2: Future]
12 tryin' come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 2: Drake]
Man, where your ass was at when we took the city over?
Where your ass was at when all they'd ask was "what's the hold up?"
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news?
Now your ass around because we’re paying back dues
Where were you? When all the dogs needed help
Lawyers and the commissary ain’t gon’ pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom?
Where your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain’t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I’m self-made, selfish with my women, self-employed
I’ll buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise
Man, where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, last winter was the coldest?
Fuck where you was at, I had the 6 on my shoulders

[Hook 1: Future]
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Verse 3: Future]
60 for a walk through, bitch don’t panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food, call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog, when I was on my come-up?
The reason I’m here today cause I ain't never gave up

[Hook 1: Future]
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas wouldn’t feed me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when bitches didn’t need me?
Where your ass was at, dog, when niggas tried to run off?
Where your ass was at, dog? You made me pull this gun out

[Outro: Future]
Where you ass was at, when I was trapping in the store?
Had to struggle to get where I'm at and sell dope
Juugin' out the stove and we still bangin', honest
Blowing on the O, yo, we call that ho an onion

[Verse 1]
As I lay me down to sleep
I hear her speak to me
Hello 'Mari, how ya doin'?
I think the storm ran out of rain, the clouds are movin'
I know you're happy, cause I can see it
So tell the voice inside ya head to believe it
I talked to God about you, he said he sent you an angel
And look at all that he gave you
You asked for one and you got two
You know I never left you
Cause every road that leads to heaven's right inside you
So I can say

[Hook]
Hello, my only one, just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
Hello my only one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Oh, the good outweighs the bad even on your worst day
Remember how I'd say
Hey hey one day, you'll be the man you always knew you could be
And if you knew how proud I was
You'd never shed a tear, have a fear, no you wouldn't do that
And though I didn't pick the day to turn the page
I know it's not the end every time I see her face, and I hear you say

[Hook]
Hello my only one, remember who you are
You got the world cause you got love in your hands
And you're still my chosen one
So can you understand? One day you'll understand

[Bridge]
So hear me out, hear me out
I won't go, I won't go
No goodbyes, no goodbyes
Just hello, just hello
And when you cry, I will cry
And when you smile, I will smile
And next time when I look in your eyes
We'll have wings and we'll fly

[Hook]
Hello my only one,  just like the mornin' sun
You'll keep on risin' 'til the sky knows your name
And you're still my chosen one, remember who you are
No you're not perfect but you're not your mistakes

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori ab-
I just want you to do me a favor
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me, tell Nori about me
Tell Nori about me...

Part I

[Intro: Kacy Hill]
Mama's bailing down that road, craving 902...

[Verse 1]
She a porn star girl, oh, from the valley
(Honestly, God Bless)
Who left her hometown world all for the alley
Oh, created Lake Tahoe all from her panties
(I hope it was wet like my jumper, though)
Ooh, used to take the long way home
Long way home, all for that candy, mm

[Bridge: Kacy Hill]
Baby's hooked on feeling numb
Do do do, do do do

[Verse 2]
Jacques turn La Flame, now you rolling on an Addy
50 on her chain, 'nother 50 on her caddy, oh
He might pop him a pill, pop him a seal, pop anyone
Pop anything, pop anything to find that alley
Hmm, yeah, then find an alley, mm

[Bridge: Kacy Hill]
Baby's hooked on feeling numb
Do do do, do do do

[Chorus: Travis Scott & Kacy Hill]
In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley
In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley, ooh
It's the superstar girl, superstar girl, roaming in that alley
Baby's hooked on feeling numb
In the 90210, 90210, somewhere in that alley

Part II

[Verse 3]
My granny called, she said "Travie, you work too hard
I'm worried you'll forget about me"
I'm falling in and out of cuffs
Don't worry, I'mma get it, granny
What happened? Now my daddy happy, mama called me up
That money coming and she love me, I done made it now
I done found life's meaning now
All them days her heart'd break, her heart not in pieces now
Friends turning into fraud niggas
Practicing, have the passion, you niggas packaged different
All you niggas, you niggas want the swag, you can't have it
I'mma sell it, you niggas salad, we 'bout the cabbage
Youngest nigga outta Houston at the Grammys
Smiling at 'em laughing at me
I passed the rock to Ye, he pump faked and passed it back, bitch
All of this off of rapping, should've wrote this in Latin
Yeah, mmm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Cuzzo said we in the store, yeah, we 'bout to drop a 4
He pass the cigarette, I choke
Tell my auntie put them poles down, them poles down
Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin' nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em
Good lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Distant sky from north of the border, my chips is in order
My mom's biggest supporter so now niggas support a nigga
###############
[Hook: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, Lord knows I'm filthy rich
All this ice is like 50 bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm 56
They say I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church have you wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble, I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game, Philly as shit
Look at these rappers, they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose, came up from nothing
And now they like, "How he made millions so quick?"
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca, no way

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me, that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
250 thou what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game 'til FOX be on
CNN, momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything, got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Stick and moving on these niggas, get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler, that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its 80 mil, pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it

[Verse 1]
Keep it one hundred, I’m one hundred and one
I ain’t talking dalmatians up under the sun
On the road to Damascus, gun and a suit
You either coming with some products or you coming for loot
I’m coming with the peace so I’m chucking the deuce
I ain’t tryna run a train I’m just in the caboose
And I’m tryna give these niggas the truth
I ain’t ‘bout to spazz on ‘em, give ‘em light
I’m just doing my Zeus
Rubbing on her body just like a masseuse
And it’s money like a hobby for you to seduce
But if you blink twice nigga you can Maduse
See the snakes in here, look there's hate in there
I pray that you niggas all playing fair
You can’t help but stare as you face the glare, yeah
I’m not up on in short yellow
With a helmet on my head while I’m eating marshmallows
Playing jigsaw while I’m picking off devils
I can rock this shit on all levels
Straight up out the ES, journey over BS
I’m like a hundred kilos stuffed in the Prius
I’m going hard ‘til they free us

[Hook]
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you

[Verse 2]
Have you ever put your hand over fire just to see what you could tolerate?
And you can find no escape
Life is a Dominatrix waiting for shit to pollinate
To make you mind your mistakes
Keeping my chin down, nose clean, with my guards up
Charged up ‘cause this ghetto got me scarred up
Yes, I’m the child with the crookedest smile
Look at my foul, look at what the star bucks
You can’t swim if you don’t paddle
Wake up in the morning with my nose to the gravel
Bloodhound, for that federal reserve note
That’s when I noticed the switch niggas just turned coats
It's the way of the world, carry the weight of the world
Carry a blade too, for they forsake you
Yeah, I’m the vision, from the night I was born
To be the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm
I own a clock, ain’t no need for alarms
Just get on your A-game when it’s time to perform
Yeah, and I can show you what it feels like
The moment they want you defeated but yet you still fight
So what it feel like?

[Hook]
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Hold up wait a minute
Let me put some season in this Gumbo
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, flavor
Whole lot of flavor, for you

[Skit]
- "Hold up, wait a minute / Let me put some season in this gumbo"
- Nigga, shut the fuck up! Hey, hey! I'm tryna play you this new Rock, and you still singin' that shit. No nigga, new Rock! My nigga...
- But it ain't this gumbo from Mrs. Johnson
- Man, fuck you and Mrs. Johnson!
- Nigga, what you sayin? That's my Sunday school teacher, dawg. Look, if it ain't better than this gumbo I got from Mrs. Johnson then we gon' have some real problems, man. I'm just sayin'
- Look, my nigga. Relax, my nigga. Listen to this shit

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Because you treat me like shit
I paid for the bed and never even slept in it
I paid for that crib I never stepped foot in
And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change, now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades, cause I'm stone crazy
Girl, we grown, stop playing on my phone, baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing
Understandable, I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back?

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and uh, that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go, you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early 20's
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short, and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy, I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy!

[Hook: Action Bronson]
Why you always all on my back?
Why you gotta do me like that?
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?
Baby girl I'm blue

[Intro: Game]
(Johnny Juliano)
(Cardo got wings)
Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there, talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing

[Verse 1: Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors when you can’t do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How a nigga s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Dre told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, "Why a nigga can’t live?"
Get this money, fuck these bitches though
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
"We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical"
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my Four Pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas, be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up

[Hook: Drake + Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hundred
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred
L.A., all I ever asked is one hundred
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred
All I ever asked is one hundred

[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans if I didn't go pop
And I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself...

[Hook: Drake + Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me

L.A., all I ever asked is one hundred
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hundred
All I ever asked is one hundred

[Verse 3: Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, "Here it go"
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'm a always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga

[Hook: Drake + Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do with me

Lyrically I’m, untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

[Verse 1]
Yuugh, I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it, the wrist is magic
The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless it’s getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Can’t you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha
I’m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
And rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like, interior gauze
It feels like, still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceiling’s open, I Cross-Fit the coca
Yuugh! It’s a different calisthenics when I do the Lennox
Half a million paralleled and ain’t nothin’ rented
Yeah, wearing Dri-Fit in my shit
It rides a little better in the cockpit

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

[Verse 2]
Mu told me to switch styles
He just came home from the Feds like a mistrial
He tells me I miss out on all that club money, I don’t bounce
Adidas gave me a million and that don’t bounce
The president of G.O.O.D. Music has been announced
A quarter million a year and that don’t bounce
I’m in the score of these movies, I’m losing count
Mu, you knew me from thirteen hundred an ounce
My breakdown game bought me ‘8 Mile’ fame
Selling Eminem to him and ‘em
White to the Blacks I’m a villain in
The Rolls Royce, playing peek-a-boo with the emblem
Let’s talk about it gentlemen
My barcode is Netflix “Narcos”
Part on the side of my 'fro like I’m Pablo
No hablo, I sell blow
Lone wolf, no Tonto, head honcho
Yuugh, let’s take the scenic route
I could show you the strange fruit
It’s looking like Beirut
They open the wash bay, I climb it like K2
These kilos are drought killers, I flooded the Jesús, I made use
Of every Spanish name I done ran across
No matter what the weight, I done ran it off
I’m walking on water, I took the sandals off
Tell A&E to turn the cameras off, Push

[Hook: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Untouchable, uncrushable
Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

The King
When you’re king of African music you’re the King
Because music is the king of all professions
(N.U. Music)

[Verse 1]
Best laid plan, make a mess, made
Damnation, let's play hands, sans spades
That's without, a boycott and a sit-out
Afro-Black pick in with a fist out
From the "Welcome Home" to the kick out
Reach into a rabbit, pull a trick out
Preacher preaching to a faggot with his dick out
Hard times call for armed time, hmm
Sick, sick, sick eyes from the nose pressure
Police snip zip ties on the protesters
Six wives in the fry of a molester
Met him at a caviar bar out in Odessa
Dirty needles breaking all the old records
A hundred hoes, one shovel and some old treasure
Ole Zeke use teeth as a gold tester
Finger rolls, finger waves, closet full of old leathers
Old sweaters, old boots, that's a whole suit for some cold weather
New sale, two L's and some old letters
Now he doing double life, while she lead a double life
Man, he need another wife
New approach might help a nigga bowl better
New hoes might help a nigga hold together
Or will the new lane lead em' to the same pen?
And the hunger strike in em' to the same tin

[Hook 1]
Love is Looking Over Various Errors
And Hate is Habitually Accelerating Terror
Everywhere but the mural
I just wanna be collected when I call god damn
I don't wanna be accepted; not as all as I am
Visitor, visitor, prisoner, prisoner, lamb

[Verse 2]
Getting slammed from the protest, no food
Force fed him like OB with a nose tube
Visions say consult the yogi with the gold shoes
With the Rollie going bowling for the old school
I need more for the Michaels
That's a loss for the class and a score for the rifles
Three hots and a cot and some cops
Trying to find dinosaurs in the Bible
It's all quiet in the jailhouse
Then they ride in to find the empty cells out
They was looking for the swords
They was looking for the swords
I'm just looking at they feet cause I'm looking for the Lord
Looking in the library, looking at the law
10 years deep, now I'm looking at the bar
Claim sovereignty cause I'm bunkin' with the moors
They degenerate, they ain't looking at the game
They just looking at the scores, they be putting on my books
Cause I'm looking at the stars, trade a shank for some crank
Now I'm looking at a war, BGF got the yard
AB got the kitchen, snitches on PC
M&M on a mission but CO's got the prison
God got us all, God set us free
God is the key, but the guards got the doors

Punching on the glass
Scared that some killer might fuck him in the ass
Staff getting rigid, wasn't gonna take away the visits
Segregate niggas by theyself and make 'em stay with it
Wicked, swung the shank around on a mop string
They had to pull him out the cell with a SWAT Team
That's a cop team
They sent hella cops to stop the helicopteriiiing...
Man, he thought that he'd fly away
Like a kite, take flight, like a letter on a string
Like propellers on a wing but the kite was the key
They made electric chairs for his dying days
Last meals, no appeals for him to try and stay
On Death Row like Suge and the late Pac
Maybe he could dig a tunnel out of A Block
And wear gloves for the razor-wired gate top
Scared thugs going crazy in a caged box
Looking at the world through the TV
And they gone, rapping over beats from the tabletops
Ay! That's how it is in a police state
When your life is just a number and release date
When you're rehabilitated so correctly
And let's hope that's how you're living when you're set free

The orange wings of the new Jim Crow
Are dyed Klansman sheets and court papers
Dreadlocks nooses hang from his neck
As the new Jim Crow Corporations feed him seeds yet unborn
He’ll be captured by Maya in a ruby-encrusted cage
I see the light at the end of the tunnel
And answers that I leave in empty pages to be written
Where is your pen? The new Jim Crow
(The new Jim Crow, the new Jim Crow, Crow, Crow, Crow...)

[Verse 1]
They sell they souls, they sell their selves
They ain't twelve, they old, niggas old as hell
Old as jail, old as cells
Sold so much salt, ain't no more salt on the shelves
You a prisoner too, you living here too
You just like us, til' your shift get through
You could look like us, you know shit get through
You should be in cuffs like us, you should get strike too
You should get like life, you should get like woo!
You should get that twice! You should get refused
The open road, that's no parole and no control
Over your own soul, so control
Your own remote control that your folks can hold

[Hook]
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)

[Verse 2]
5th year with the DOC
You can see what's CO see
Robocop opt his C-O-P
3 hots and a C-O-T
Lived in a small town, his whole life
Never left, soundin' like the hole, right?
Either working at the prison, or it's no lights
In the system working with the po-lice
In the prison stripping niggas phone rights
Got a malice, on the other side of the bars
Watching niggas get smart, watching niggas get strong
Watching niggas get home, he jail us
But deep down he jealous
With each sweep down, he tell us
With each beat down, he help us
Wrong one gon' knock his ass out though
It's why he gotta lock all the niggas out for
Warden told the boy he better calm down
Step back from the brink and put the bomb down
But how the whole world in your palm sound?
It's why they treat niggas like shit
Writing raps to the taps
Keep the face mask on 'em these niggas might spit!

[Hook]
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)
If it was up to me, I would never unlock these niggas
Wouldn't rehabilitate, man, I would just box these niggas
And throw away the key
I'd throw away the key like the coast guard watching me
I'd throw away the keys
I'd throw away the keys, I'd throw away the keys
You better watch these niggas (en garde)

[Verse]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

[Bridge 2]
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Chorus]
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all

[Outro]
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD

I made a promise to my mama
That I'll bless her with some grandkids, she can spoil them
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day (homie)
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get them all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah
Now we All-American, we All-American

[Verse]
I swear to God I put the hero in Heroin
These flows, kilos
I could sell snow to a ski slope
I could sell evil to the devil
Nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic
I went pro, made profit
Now I keep some dead faces in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twisting my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me?
Stop tripping, I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately
You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated
And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it
I know (I know)
I got a problem, I'mma take care of it
Weight I'm carrying,  gotta let it go
(It won't hold me down no more)

[Hook]
I made a promise to my mama
That I'll bless her with some grandkids, she can spoil them
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta

Came a long way from all-state, yeah
Now we All-American, we All-American

[Post-Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere

Back then I had a dream
I'll get this money, man

[Intro: Logic]
Yeah yeah, what up Bobby
Like goddamn, like goddamn
This that 9-5 shit right here
Take 'em back to the 90s!
Like goddamn, like goddamn
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Take them back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind (yeah yeah)
See I'm a self diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah

[Hook: Logic]
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

[Verse 2: Big Lenbo & Logic]
Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus; flow prestigious
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis
Better believe us or leave us
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, "woo-hah"
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man
Bitches want an autograph, I sign them titties in crayon
Like goddamn!
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
It's me and B-I, B-I, B-I-G L-N-B-O, L-N-B-O
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal
Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

[Hook: Logic]
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

[Verse 3: Logic & Big Lenbo]
Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegle, interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Beretta
You know I get better by givin' the people
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
"The Return of the Jedi"
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do
This shit is (overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck that, nigga
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs, know we always keep it real
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just (301 reppin', second I step in Maryland)
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest
Finger fuck a critic
Shit is darker than "The Chronicles of Riddick"
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on

Fuck practice, this shit just happens, know y'all can't stand it

Won't hug your bitch when the ho ratchet
Cold jumper, been shootin', no practice
Been tourin', whip foreign, coupe crashin'
Still bangin' 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still "fuck the police" they won't catch me
My feature too pricey, don't ask me
Go hard, 'til Goyard on my baggage
He mad we won't fight, I'm gon' tag him

Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... look)

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay I feel better at work
I mean whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'mma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you "dog"
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay mom mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Intro: King Mez]
Where you at? where you from?
Whatcha doing over here, motherfucker?
Whatcha think? what you bang?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game

[Verse 1: King Mez]
Now I ain't never been no gangsta
But I know niggas, know niggas, from the darkside
There's some cold killas, cold killas (my nanny used to tell me)
My nigga used to roll with us, roll with us (every night)
Married to the more money, more women
Now I ain't ever been the one that'll pull a gun on you
But I know who got 'em
No, I never sold no drugs, homie
But I know who got 'em
And I never had no fucking bullets in me
But I know who got 'em
If you die tonight, you die tonight
Momma might cry tonight if she find you high off the dynamite
But to you is just another Friday night
Got a nigga for the car tonight
With the bible right beside that pile of white
That's what this life is like
(Now do you love your life?)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Now please don't give me a reason, reason
Cause I know you wanna keep breathing this evening
I've been killing the game for seasons, believe him
That I'm the motherfuckin' one to breed them and lead 'em
In a league of my own
You ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorized for this song
Might be best for you to get goin'
Best be careful about your tone
That shit can hit me wrong and it's on
I have tried my best to be calm
Please don't make me grab that phone
Now who you know who came this fucking far
From the fucking bottom?
30 years in this bitch and I'm still here
Decade after decade
And evidently I must be doing something right
Word to my nigga Eazy

[Interlude: Eazy-E]
Eazy-E C-P-T OG from the other side (Eazy)

[Part 2: Gone]

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars L.A. has ever seen
People been telling me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though, I've been this way since 17
Tryna get finances poppin', man, I thought that was the object
To some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
My only dream was holding us down like fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm young and black
Killing them softly
Don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
We ain't even talking, fuck that energy, fuck up off me

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
You look at my lifestyle, I'm living my life now
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin, how come my attitude piped down?
I'm fuckin' with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit that you only can get on an oversea flight now
You scared of my heights now
But still I got enemies giving me energy, I don't wanna fight now
Subliminally sent to me all of this hate, I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video? But really no clue you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin every now and then you hang yourself
Cause I got the green and gold with a million sold
Plus plenty more, and my dollar thick
But with or without all the diamonds though to you I'm just another nigga

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Angels, na, na, na, na

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

[Hook: Saba]
They was talking "woo woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

[Post-Hook: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you? And who the fuck is you? And who is him?
All of a sudden woo wap da bam you can't touch me
Na, na, na, na I got angels
I got angels

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

[Hook: Saba & Chance The Rapper]
They was talking "woo woo, this woo wap da bam"

Turn  it  up
Can you turn this up
Just zone out
Just close your eyes
Ay, can we dim the lights in here?
Can we dim the lights, please
Yeah

[Hook: Rod Stewart + Miguel]
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go...

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Off again, there he go
To another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye
Prolly goin' ballistic, but listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws
They ain't never do drillin', true, you
Been sippin' away at the truth
A double shot of wisdom'll do, do, do
Rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses
To the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence
Go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us (Amen)
And only God can judge me (yeah) and he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holla if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless
But hold it, I'm gettin' close as my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts
A solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions
Adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

[Hook: Rod Stewart + Miguel]
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a facade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

[Bridge: Miguel]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

[Hook: Miguel + Rod Stewart]
So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes I am
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow

But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

Money ain't a thing if I got it
Mo-mo-money ain't a thing if I got it
Money

[Hook]
Before the money, there was love
But before the money, it was tough
Then came the money through a plug
It's a shame this ain't enough

[Verse 1]
Yo, sitting back plotting, jotting information on my nation
Really started from the bottom, boy cotton
But they still planting plantations, we keep buying in
Closed-minded men
Pride is higher than the prices on your Pradas and Balenciagas Balance my saga with the Henny agua
Me and my niggas tryna eat, you pussies empanada
The flow like plenty lava
With just a penny I could multiply my worth
And make you work for me for twenty hours
I swear these niggas love to copy, thanks for listening
The kid ain't been the same
Since Biggie smacked me at my christening
Watch what you dishing and please play it safe
Cause your position on the top is switching right in front your face
Rock you outta space with rhymes, I'm bustin' out
Keep ducking down, got some missiles now, headed for your house
So put the pistols down, got that red dot on your nose
Who booked the clown? I lock jaws like a blue nose
Foes keep your mouth closed or you can see the solar
I got connections that guaranteed to see closed doors
You hear that underground sonar
The way I flows then switch them
The Pros been on a mission
Listen, enter the chamber, get hyperbolic
They raisin' Macs, I raise steaks to keep them brolic
My visions is macrocosmic, pass the chronic
The mastered sonics is light years above your conscious
You're novice, but I got notes that strike nerves
I promise your minds ain't sharp like my swords
So cut the BS, and don't worry where my jeans is
And PS: Your bitch a genius, learned from my penis
I got dreams selling arenas and breaking brackets
Tenants racket, while I'm cracking a Serena
God damn, God bless the heaven that sent you
But now I'm breezing out, baby, cause my rent's due

[Verse 2 (DJ Premier cuts)]
Shit is really real out here
I said shit is really real out here (It ain't  easy)
Just trying to get a deal out here
(Money ain't a thing if I got it)
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene
Yo, I'm screaming cream, who fucking with the rap supreme?
Joey Bad and Big Preem came to collect the green
I got a dollar and a dream, know what I mean?
And I gotta get my mama off the scene (Joey Badass)
Cause cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
Cash ruined everything around me
(Won’t sign to no major if no wager) (money ain't a thing)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills (It ain't easy)
They say money is the root of all evil
I see money as the route of all people
Cause we all follow paper trails, paper trails
And everybody gotta pay their bills, pay their bills
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, it's the dollar bill that kills, y'all
It's the dollar dollar bill, y'all

Man's never been in Marquee when it's shutdown eh? Trusss me daddi
(Man's never been in)

[Hook: Skepta]
When it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In a black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

[Verse 1: Skepta]
Yeah, take time
If a man wanna try me, no time
Usain Bolt when I run up on stage
I pick up the mic and it's reload time
Don't know your songs but they know mine
That's why I got gigs just like Joe Grind
After the show I be rolling mine
Don't care bout the no smoking sign
They try to steal my vision
This ain't a culture, it's my religion
God knows I don't wanna go prison
But if a man wanna try me, trust me, listen
Me and my Gs ain't scared of police
We don't listen to no politician
Everybody on the same mission
We don't care about your -isms and schisms

[Hook: Skepta]
Cause it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In a black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

[Verse 2: Skepta]
You wanna act like a G for the camera
You say you're Muslim, you say you're Rasta
Say you don't eat pork, don't eat pussy
Liar, you're just a actor
Blud, you're not on your deen
And if Selassie saw you he would say
"Blud take off the red gold and green"
Them man are soft just like ice cream
Seen? Start moving correctly
If you don't wanna upset me, you get me?
You tryna show me your Fendi
I told you before, this shit don't impress me
I bet I make you respect me
When you see the mandem are selling out Wembley
Roll deep in a blacked out Bentley
Pull up outside like "wah gwan sexy"

[Hook]
Yeah, and it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In a black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

[Skit]
A bunch of young men all dressed in black dancing extremely aggressively on stage, it made me feel so intimidated and it's just not what I expect to see on prime time TV

[Verse 3: Skepta]
I'm in a different class
When I get through I'mma bring my dargs
2 by 2, man a walk on the ark
Sittin' at the front, just like Rosa Parks
Trust me, you don't wanna see me get dark
Upset cause man are way up right now
And the shit happened all so fast
I was in Paris, shut down l'Arc
New York, shut down Central Park
Talk about London, yo Frisco where shall I start?
Walked in, spat ten 16 bars
And each and every one of them came from the heart
None of my lyrics are stolen
"Go on then, go on then", that's my slogan
Wanna know how I did it with no label
No A-list songs, and I told them

[Hook]
Blud, I just shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In a black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

[Outro: Drake]
Link up Daddy

[Verse 1]
Bitch, you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurkin', don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave and get shaded
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back
In the function, one wrong word, start bustin'
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shootin' in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a creole
T-Skrap moving for the d-low, and he know

[Hook]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach

[Verse 2]
Hit the corner, make a dollar flippin'
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Knowin' change gonna come like Obama and them say
But they shootin' everyday 'round my mama and them way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Crippin' where I'm livin', come and follow me
Pistol poppin', Poppy Street (Poppy Street)

[Hook]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Northside, Long Beach, Northside, Long Beach

[Verse 3]
Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga
Who you murdered? You ain't heard of Coldchain
Best thang, smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty runnin' Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Frontin' with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from street, they a nigga best, yes
'Cept for Little Halftime, Brody bangin' five blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Crippin', Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop block the corner
Givin' hell 'til it's frozen over, I ain't never ran from nothin'

[Hook]
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police

[Intro]
Alright
Uh, uh, uh

[Hook]
Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

[Verse 1]
I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
Step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it
Don't give a fuck, pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel
We had females come in every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob, scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand
Steady handling my job, time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent, niggas' shit
Bitch

[Hook]
Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

[Verse 2]
My fleeting thoughts on a leash
For the moment, high as fuck
I've been alone in my shit, for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Momma taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs, riding in 'em
I'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight like a collar
When you iron that
Thinking 'bout my grandmama, find a bottle
I'mma wallow when I lie in that
I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back

I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed

Get low, alright

Stay low, alright

Well, well, well, let me run (let me run)
Let me run to see who came undone

Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa

[Intro]
Oh man, oh man, oh man, not again

[Verse]
Yeah, I learned the game from William Wesley
You can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Whoa, very important and very pretentious
When I look back I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad ‘cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout-out to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you’d do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'...
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

[Intro]
Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some black, I ain't mean black (And pray to a God)
I want everything black (That we don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

[Bridge]
Six in the morn', fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn, that's all I wanna see
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me
Black don't crack, my nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feeling this way since I was 16, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village
Pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Hook]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 2]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're telling me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me till I'm dead
Church me with your fake prophesizing that I'mma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

[Pre-Hook]
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot

[Hook: Assassin]
I said they treat me like a slave, cah' me black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we black
And man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars pon' me back
But now we have a big whip parked pon' the block
All them say we doomed from the start, cah' we black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

[Verse 3]
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this if you listenin' then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm black as the name of Tyrone and Darius
Excuse my French but fuck you — no, fuck y'all
That's as blunt as it gets, I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you're in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gone bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State "Marcus Garvey got all the answers"
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit...

[Pre-Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Turn me up
Sin City, Sin City
Sin City, Sin City

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Big money, big booty bitches
Tell the truth, nigga, I'm lost without it
7 figures for a headline
You want some stage time, we can talk about it
Niggas actin' like they be rappin'
Like nice on the mic, truly doubt it
Go against the kid, y'all don't wanna live
That decision is hella childish
Rose gold for my old hoes
They ain't satisfied then I sit 'em down
10th grade, I gave her all shade
But now she got some ass, I wan' hit it now
I don't lease, I just all out feast
I put a blue Caprice on Gary Coleman
Bomb head and some cheese eggs
That's a new raise and a signing bonus

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Fall in this bitch
Like some good pussy, can't stand myself
So good, she so hood
She a cheesehead, patty melt
GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs
That shit was happening
She reel me in with some chicken wings
And some collard greens, that shit was brackin'
Just cracked me a new bitch
Bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey
My bitch get off at 9 o'clock
So I had to shake her 'round 7:30
105, I'm stomping fast
With these big guns, I'm hella dirty
Get caught with this shit
I ain't comin' home 'til like 2030

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might ban myself
I just might... God!

[Bridge: Jay Rock]
I'm focused feeling blessed
Cause my eyes be the truth
I'm focused feeling blessed
Cause my eyes be the truth

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Mental window blurry as a bitch
Still lookin' out it
So much money off the fuckin' books
Could write a book about it
Took a minute, no, wait a minute
Let me think about it
Bout ten years, Crips, Bloods
Sweat and tears, and we still counting
Had a real thick bitch named Brooklyn
She fucked the whole squad
Now every time I land in Brooklyn
They fuck with the whole squad
I'm more spiritual than lyrical
I'm similar to Eli, why?
Cause I'm wearin' black shades
And I'm headed west with the word of God (Amen)
I think I'm finally ready to talk about it
These niggas just talk about it
Homie you don't play me for no fool
Poppin' bottles like enemigos
Ay dios mio, I'm so cold
Get so deep in that water, water
They should call my johnson a harpoon

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Feed the needy, don't know graffiti
Paint her walls like a cartoon
Beat the pussy up so bad
Send her home with some war wounds
Loaded off the 'gnac, hit her from the back
Goin' 'cross her head, bar stool
Touch her soul, 'til I curl her toes
Then it's time to reload, then it's part two

[Verse 5: ScHoolboy Q]
Damn near 30, still set trippin' cuz
Where you're from, I'ma see about it
Last year I made ten million
That's where I've been, yeah, a private island
Smoking something, on autopilot
Got too many cars, I might crash a whip
New 'Rari pedal barely tapping
Nigga, vroom-vroom, yeah, I'm rich, bitch
Got two rollies, but one missing
Think my daughter flossing, she in kindergarten
Got one crib worth two cribs
And my front lawn, yeah, that's water fountain
You be talking boss, saying big words
Like philosophies, man, you weird homie
What it sounds to me that you broke as fuck
And your bitch gon' leave, and that's real, homie

[Verse 6: ScHoolboy Q]
A dashiki on, with a fedora on
And my round glasses, tryna fool the cops
I'm with you Dot, on that sneak dissing
When you penny bitchin', nigga, shoot the fade
Ugly nigga, but I'm fine as wine
Did you check your time? I get good with age
Shoot the nine, like fourth grade
Black Hippy droppin', eyebrows raised

[Bridge: Jay Rock]
I'm focused feeling blessed
Cause my eyes be the truth
I'm focused feeling blessed
Cause my eyes be the truth

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
That shit gon' be the death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I just might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might damn myself
I just might... GOD!... GOD!

[Verse]
We're all chemicals, vitamins and minerals
Vicodin with inner tubes, wrapped around the arm
To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
Top Cat chat, let's begin another yarn
That's flying saucer cheese, or is it chicken parm'?
But roosters don't fly like boosters don't buy
So what powers cowards to get them to the top
Just to fall asleep listening to Bach?
The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
That lacks meaning, but racks up stacks of fat reading
They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
Now what's a coffin with a scratched ceiling?
And what's the talking without the match feeling
That's buried living? And cherry picking
Every lemon from your berry system
Then proceed with the pack feeding
When I was young I had visions of another world
Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
I like my pancakes cut in swirls
Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
I like cartoons, southern cities with large moons
Faith healers, ex-female drug dealers and art booms
Apologize for my weird mix
What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
And smells like shotguns and deer piss
They on their hunt, kind of salty that I'm going hard
First part of a party, that I throw in parts
One minute you're playing pool, next minute you're throwing darts
But that's how you do with a party that you throw in bars
I run the Gambit like I'm throwing cards
From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
Nerd gang, make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
Backup the wordplay playing at the man's states
Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
And when demand brakes I'm reflectious, what they can't face
My peers will still treat the mirror like it's a fan base
The unfettered veteran, the eagle feathered man of medicine
That hovers above cities like weather men
And maybe weather woman
Whatever better to tell ya weather comin'
I prefer girls to reign all over the world
And not rain like, rain man or rain like rain dance
Or rain like a slight chance of rain when it's raining
Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
But reign like Queens that reign over made man
And not Queen like Queen killer, rhapsody bohemian Queen
But Queen, like white glove wave hand, and not wave hand, like it's a heat wave
So you make a fan by waving your hand, I'm talking wave, like you saying, "Hey man!"
And not hay for horses, and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
You gotta treat your vocal chords, like it's a fortress
And treat every single one of your words, like reinforcements
And especially when you're recording
Cause that's the portion that's important
When I was reporting, that I was poor,but now I'm more than (poor)
It's still hooker heels, on my sugar hills, and sweet spots
Crying shames, make margarita rims, from cheap tops
Deep plots, in floor to ceiling windows, for my peep pots
A little scene, with the sickle swings, to make the wheat drop
And a hundred words, for them hummingbirds, that like to eavesdrop
And fan out, like peacocks, with a parakeet that beat box
So the sun rise, when the beat drops, and the sun dies, when the beat stops...
Then it unties, then it relocks, then it relapsed, then it detox
Then heat back, like a heat pack, on his knee caps of the weak spot
Cause he want what we got, like yeah

Then forge poetry, like a young ornery Morrissey
Then spit it to the golden locks thots, who like their porridge all watery
Not scorching, nor sorbet-y
From the steel orbitings, sorcerer, sorcery
Coming down gorgeously, just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
A more torturing, a water-boarding, Barbie doll
A river of women, like a Brazilian Carnival
Swimming in feminine bikinis, made out of Barbasol
Somebody give them the volleyballs
If you love her, don't ever send her to Mally Mall's
Homie, if she lonely she might end up in Macauly's claws
Coming out the closet over goblets, down at Madri Gras
The fame, champagne, walk of shame lobby call
My rap position, was black condition, and activism
Ammunition for abolition, missions attacking systems
But they're not apt to listen, unless it's dropping on Activision
Are we apps, or are we bodies filled with apparitions?
Operating applications, stuck inside an Apple prison
Chicken hack, and download updates that lack religion
Or are we more...
...Than soil tainting, disloyal changelings
Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing, and foiling other's royal saintings?
I sit back and watch the world, through eye holes, in my oil paintings
Uhhh! Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
Unless you Virgin Mary, nothin' do it but the truest
Believe all that, unless you Jewish
Life is not a dictionary, it's a thesaurus
And I feel like a missionary, to a clitoris
The water bearer, heir of traditions, that I swear to never change
My chair position, or conditions of my porridge
Submission for sedition, against the religion of a chorus
Keep them golden weave thieves, out the mothafuckin' forest
As I perform a nerve storm, I prefer my pictures in word form
Bury the hatchet, like how a bird born
As I paint cold pictures, like Kool-Aid facing condensation
Having conversations with flavorful combinations
Slave to my concentration, so that's OJ da Juiceman, meets OJ with two hands
And two gloves, that's too snug, to judge who was, who drew blood
And, Lupe look at all these toucans, in a cemetery full of tomahawks
Giving middle fingers, to the pigeons doing somersaults
Road runners don't fall off cliffs, they run across
Anomalies by the colony, flukes by the reservoir
Wildin' pursuers end up as poofs, on the desert floor
Levitating youths, who know the truth of where the fountain hides
Buccaro roof painting tunnels, onto the mountain sides
A thousand parts, a pound of heart, an ounce of eyes
Announcing now, the doubt in mouth, pronounces a count of lies
Chocula Counts, by the count of five
Refrigerator roof, full of animals and monsters
Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
Assorted memories from my childhood
Absorbing energy from the wild woods
Electronic combat Konami sign contract
Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
Chicago, spray gun aficionado
Efficient spitting bridging divisions isn't Chicano
Who’s the Boss? If it isn't Alyssa Milano
Dudikoff, ninja mission into the Congo
Polarize envy of the older guys
Black obi, shinobi hittin' Kenno in the face with all my throwin' knives
Sub-zero guiding, hiding, riding in the pack as well
Sound village, Leaf village, wolf spirit, magic spells
Dodging rain and catching hail
Faces need samurais to catch the L
Special research vessels made for catching whales
Filet-o-fish ships sea-shepherded peppered with extra sails
Rewrite history, liberty needs a better bell
Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
To announce that you've had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
Cuba-scuba couldn't take the temperature of my skill pool
Yeah, I said it feels cool to kill fools
Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin' chill mood
Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin' wheel shoes
Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews
Oblivious feather-weight baker who autographed cakes whenever his quill moves over your milieu
Simple as a Buddhist monk in a temple standing in some heel groove with the abbot, practising stillness
Real still til' he realize his realness
Defeat Samsara, achieves nirvana and brilliance
Yeah!

Make her say ha like a nigga was Juve
Soon as that work hit the city, we move it

[Hook: Future]
Dirty soda in a styrofoam
Spend a day to get my mind blown
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
Til these niggas start acting
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gon let 'em have it
Ballin' like the March Madness
All these cops shooting niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's living lavish
Like I'm playing for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average

Don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote
Poppin' pills is all we know
In the hills is all we know (Hollywood!)
Don't go through the front door (Through the back!)
It's lowkey at the night show
So don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote

[Verse 1]
Party on a Sunday (That was fun!)
Do it all again on Monday (One more time!)
Spent a check on a weekend (Oh my God!)
I might do it all again (That's boss shit)
I just hit a three peat (Wooh)
Fucked three hoes I met this week (Robert Horry!)
I don't do no old hoes (Oh, no, no!)
My nigga, that's a no-no (Straight up!)
She just want the coco (Cocaina!)
I just want dinero (Paper hunting!)
Who that at the front door? (Who that is?)
If it's the feds, oh-no-no-no (Don't let 'em in, shhh)

[Hook]
Don't you open up that window

[Verse 3]
Stackin' up day to day
Young nigga you know you gotta go get it, go get it, my nigga
They hatin', they stinkin', they waitin'
Don't be mistaken, we dyin', they stayin'
Lord I'm on fire they think that I'm Satan
Callin' me crazy on different occasions
Kickin' the cameraman off of my stages
Cause I don't like how he snappin' my angles
I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated
Like these two bitches that might be related
H-Town, you got one and you Bun B like a number one
It's late night, got a late show
If you wanna roll, I got a place where...

Boi-1da, what's poppin'?

[Verse 1:]
Runnin' through the 6 with my woes
Countin' money, you know how it goes
Pray the real live forever, man
Pray the fakes get exposed
I want that Ferrari then I swerve
I want that Bugatti just to hurt
I ain't rockin' my jewelry, that's on purpose
Niggas want my spot and don't deserve it
I don't like how serious they take themselves
I've always been me I guess I know myself
Shakiness, man, I don't have no time for that
My city too turned up I'll take the fine for that
This been where you find me at
That's been where you find me at
I know a nigga named Johnny Bling
He put me on to the finer things
Had a job sellin' Girbaud jeans
I had a yellow TechnoMarine
Then Kanye dropped, it was polos and backpacks
Man, that was when Ethan was pushin' a Subaru hatchback
Man, I'm talkin' way before hashtags
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
(Yeah!)

[Beat Switch]

[Hook:]
I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You know how that should go

Runnin' through the 6 with my woes

You know how that should go
Don't fuck with them niggas, they too irrational, woah

[Verse 2:]
This is that nasty flow
Top boy in this shit, I'm so international
Reps up is in here
Got P Reign and Chubby and TJ and Winnie and woah
Yeah, and you know how that shit go
I might declare it a holiday as soon as Baka get back on the road
Yeah, but you know how that shit go
They so irrational, they don't wanna patch it up
They wanna mash it up, woah
My nigga Jibba, he whip it, I ride in the passenger
I'm way up, I stay up, I'm two up, I'm three up
I had to get back to you, woah
I'm turnin' into a nigga that thinks about money and women
Like 24/7, that's where my life took me
That's just how shit happened to go, yeah, and you know
Runnin' through the 6 with my, with my

[Hook:]
I was running through the 6 with my woes

[Intro]
I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghost writer?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell
(A two man cell)
Something's in the water (something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
24/7, 365 days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (oh yeah)

[Hook]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my mama and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo woo!
Ah yeah, fuck the judge, I made it past 25, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin' "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

[Hook]
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'—(*POP*)
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—(*POP*)
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
(King) Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where was you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Outro]
(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk)
We want the funk
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Do you want the funk?)
We want the funk
(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it)
We want the funk

I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence

[Hook]
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes and tell me whatcha thinkin'
Open up your mind, and tell me whatcha seein'
Inside of me, why we fussin', fuckin' up this evenin'
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meanin'
What's the grudge that you're holdin'?
Hold my hand let me take you to the land
Where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart, if we don't love then we fall apart
This could be forever, baby, I never seen you wetter, baby
Than when the tears fall soakin' up your sweater, baby
I didn't mean harm, don't make me regret it, baby
Cause if I never knew ya, I could never do this to ya
Hope you understand, they never taught me how to be a man
Only how to be a shooter, I only need the time to prove it

[Hook]
Cause this could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know that, this could be forever, baby

[Verse 2]
My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missin' you
I'm searchin' for atonement, do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone
Pick up the phone, don't leave me alone in this cruel, cruel world
###############
[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city…

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "God!"
Bad trips like, "Yeah!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Hook: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma comin' heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you: a house or a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
