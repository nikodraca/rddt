[Intro: Kyle + Lil Yachty]
Man, fuck
What's wrong Kyle?
Man, these kids, man, talkin' shit, makin' me feel bad
Man, fuck them kids, bro! Look around, bro, look at life
Man, you're right
Mmm, you see? You see these fine bitches over here?
Yeah, woah...
You see these trees man? You see this water?
I guess it is okay
Come on, man, you got so much more to appreciate, man
Man you know what, y-you're right...
You damn right I'm right, I can't remember a time I was god-damn wrong
Man, thanks, Lil' Boat
Hey man, that's what I'm here for

[Verse 1: Kyle]
I ain't been gettin' high...
Well maybe a little, baby I don't wanna lie
I know when you text me girl, I don't always reply
Well you're not an angel either, you can't even fly
I notice, you think that you know shit
All this shade that's comin' at me, I wonder who throws it
They can't see the vision, boy they must be out of focus
That's a real hot album homie, I wonder who wrote it, oh shit
Otay, pray them niggas go away
Always hella clowns around it look like Cirque Du Soleil
This is not the album either, these are just the throwaways
This shit still so cold when it drop, it's gonna be a mothafuckin' snow day
Ayy, boy is good and he knows it, he don't say it, he shows it
I'm just like DeRozan, if I shoot it, it goes in
I am in Cali just coastin', get 'em so wet they need coasters
I got a selfie with Oprah, I just ain't never post it
And I'm in my happy place posted, I ain't frown since '06
I ain't cried since '01,  my pad like Six Flags and your house is no fun
You can come back to mine though, your friend ain't cute but it's fine though
We gon' end on a high note

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

[Verse 2: Lil Yachty]
She said she 21, I might have to I.D. that
All my bitches come in pairs like balls in my nutsack
I remember ridin' around the city in a Hatchback
Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from "Can you take me here?" to screening out the lane
Went from "Damn this nigga lame" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
Upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Riding deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy!)
So don't fuck with me, no, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

[Chorus: Kyle]
I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind
Oh, I...I spy with my little eye
A girlie I can get 'cause she don't get too many likes
A curly-headed cutie I can turn into my wife
Wait, that means forever, ever, hold up, never mind

[Refrain: Kyle]
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I, I spy with my little eye
I spy, I spy with my little eye
Oh I...

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you God, God bless you, thank you so much)

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen court rooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so

[Hook: Big Sean]
Last night took an L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
You niggas in trouble, you niggas in trouble
If you think about runnin' with that then you in trouble

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Bridge: Camila Cabello]
The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Camila Cabello]
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

[Intro: Swae Lee & Gucci Mane]
Black Beatles in the city
Be back immediately to confiscate the moneys
(Ear Drummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL!
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive ‘em
But you said you didn't need 'em

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 1: Swae Lee]
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain
I'm a fuckin' black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see ‘em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous!"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rollin'
She think she love me, I think she trollin'

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke ho can only point me to a rich ho
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light go
They seen that Guwop and them just came in through the side door
There's so much money on the floor we buyin' school clothes
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
Pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo
I eurostep past a hater like I'm Rondo
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Verse 3: Slim Jxmmi]
She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like it's still the 80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry about a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related

[Hook: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull livin' like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinkin'
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

Know how to solve a problem, know how to sell a brick
You might be poppin' them bottles, I'm poppin' them bottles and models
You might be ridin' American, my whips is foreign, the throttles
You tryna go big on big, stop it

All this pain, we can live through it, it's called success

I won't ask the bitch unless she going to get it
It might take a minute, but she'll be sure to get it
Just to pass the test, I won't act the best
I got Actavis, there's nothing I can't ask the bitch, no
Got one missed, no missed calls, hell nah, nah
She got a man, can't get involved, nah nah
She still going all ways every time I call
We gonna ball today, we gonna ball tomorrow
I put this weight on like I put a cape on
Now that this fame came, I can see the hate on you
Mama told me stay strong, grandma told me stay on
Now she looking down, throwing blessings

You go out your way and keep cool
You go out your way and break rules
You go out your way, so out your way
You're going out your way, you can't lose
Vacate, trips to Cancun, spaceship trips to the moon
Never likes to tell the truth
Head full of hair, but the cat well groomed
Plan a trip to Peru, charter jet, me and you
You going out your way, way out your way
So I had to do this for you
Jackpot, hit the right spot, so she had to get a tattoo
It's some dirt and hurt, but ain't perfect
If she going our way, come through
Hold me down, either good or bad
Never switch, or act brand new
You go out your way and wasn't told to
So I made this song just for you

Get to the money, then double it

Made a deal that you wouldn't cross, lie to me
It was so many people that doubted me
Shit talk, shit talk, bullets starting to let off

Blast off, blast off, my career gon' blast off
We don't need y'all, want y'all, we don't have to ask y'all

Ride through the city, yeah the ball way
We was trappin', cappin' all through the hallway
Everybody said that we would fall away
Nobody thought that we would go up

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga
Aye, put two fingers in the sky if you want her
Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga

Aye, put a finger in the sky if you want it, nigga

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you worry bout the things he can't provide for ya
Whenever you around I seen it come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft spoken
I came and talked to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right
If I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

[Pre-Hook]
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams
She fuck with small town niggas, I got bigger dreams (listen)

Club jumping, don't stop, off top
But you know we only go 'till 2 o'clock
Put yo motherfuckin' hood up, it's the weekend
Drop that, back that ass up and bitches get to freaking
Last call at the bar, ladies get a drink, nigga get some balls
Ain't no telling you gonna see that bitch tomorrow
Stop holding up the wall waiting for the right song
Better holla cause you know they bout to cut the lights on

[Verse 2]
And put my number in it—
I'm staring at you from afar, I'm wondering about you
Like, where you from and who you are?
'Cause you a star—no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type to light the night time, I heard you got a man
But who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out your zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
They say it's just a matter of time
And if I had my way then you would be mine

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon

[Verse 1]
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one
Savage I ain't even hatin'"
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
"Savage I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'
Bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape"
Yeah, nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he wrappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

Heut geht alles auf mich, Taxi iz da
Übernacht' in Präsidentsuite

Zünd' Blunt an in der Q7

Und ich [?], geh beiseite, Habibi

[Intro]
Yo, bro, I think I had too much Hennessy, man
This Hennessy gettin' to me
I ain't gonna lie, I'm a little smizz
I'm a little drizz
But we in the club, man, OOOUUU

[Verse]
Yeah, they hate, but they broke though
And when it's time to pop they a no-show
Yeah, I'm pretty, but I'm loco
The loud got me movin' slow-mo
Ayo, Tweetie, where the hoes, bro?
Ayo, Keys, where the hoes though?
That other nigga, he a bozo
It's M.A, you don't know, ho?
We got liquor by the boatload (that Henny)
Disrespect the Lyfe, that's a no-no
All my niggas dressed in that rojo (Redlyfe)
I ride for my guys, that's the bro code
Baby gave me head; that's a low blow
Damn, she make me weak when she deep throat
I need a rich bitch, not a cheap ho
They be on that hate shit, I peep though
My brother told me: "Fuck 'em, get that money, sis!"
You just keep on grindin' on your hungry shit
Ignore the hate, ignore the fake, ignore the funny shit
‘Cause if a nigga violate, we got a hunnit clips (grrrrrrrah!)
And we go zero to a hundred quick (ooouuu)
We just them niggas you ain't fuckin' with (oh no)
Pockets on a chubby chick (ah)
And still go bag a thottie in some bummy shit (ooouuu)
Yerr, Eli, why they testin' me?
Like I don't always keep the hammer next to me
Like I ain't got a hitter to the left of me
Like we ain't in these streets more than Sesame
If that's your chick, then why she textin' me?
Why she keep calling my phone speaking sexually?
Every time I'm out, why she stressin' me?
You call her Stephanie? I call her Headphanie (OOOUUU)
I don't open doors for a whore
I just want the neck, nothin' more
Shawty, make it clap, make it applaud!
When you tired of your man, give me a call
Dyke bitches talking out they jaw
Next minute, calling for the law
This 9 will have 'em calling for the Lord
They ain't getting shmoney, so they bored
I could never lose, what you thought?
M.A got it on lock, man, of course
They say I got the juice, I got the sauce
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
Pussy, I'm a bully and a boss
I'm killing 'em, sorry for your loss (R.I.P.)
I just caught a body; Randy Moss
Now this year I'm really going off

[Outro]
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
Ah, these haters on my body, shake 'em off
OOOUUU, OOOUUU
These haters on my body, shake 'em off
I could never lose, what you thought?
What they thought?
I could never lose, what you thought?
This Henny got me, it got me sauced
This Henny got me, oh, it got me sauced
I could never lose, what you thought?
M.A got it on lock, man, of course
OOOUUU, OOOUUU

[Intro]
Ye, Belair nero
è la storia
Una storia come tante
Trankilo fra'

[Hook: Vegas Jones]
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Come scorre un fiume di parole
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto

[Verse 1: Vegas Jones]
Fuori è chiaro anche se è notte e ci sarà la neve
Io me ne sarò andato svelto senza dire niente
Nelle orecchie non ho più il suono delle sirene
Tira piano, il fumo passa dalle tapparelle
Non discuto con l'agente, vuole informazioni
Io non sono l'anagrafe, non li faccio i nomi
Prego il cielo mentre fumo, vedo arcobaleni
Infatti Dio sa che ne ho combinate di tutti i colori
E so che...
No, non è domenica
Ma tutti i miei sognano una domenica da Dio
Quasi meritata dopo anni passati nell'oblio
Ma tu che ne sai di interni di plastica di una Clio?
Sento plastica nelle cose che dicono
Io ci salto i pasti per le cose che ti dico mo'
Farai sempre male a non fidarti di un amico
Ad affidarti a dei bastardi a cui non piaci di principio
Quindi sai che se...

[Bridge: Vegas Jones]
Parlo solo di soldi perché i miei drammi più grandi
Non ho nemmeno coraggio di raccontarli
Tieni sempre gli occhi aperti quando giri gli angoli
Il destino è li che tira i fili, vuole che ti strangoli
Non dare corda a questi visi pallidi e stanchi
La partita la perdi quando sei al pari degli altri
Perderanno i tuoi nemici col passare degli anni
Io perdono i miei nemici, servirà a depistarli

[Hook: Vegas Jones] [x2]
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Come scorre un fiume di parole
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto

[Verse 2: Nitro]
Ho fatto un disco d'oro con un disco d'odio
Vedi il vuoto nel mio sguardo fisso perché ambisco al podio
Tu vuoi solo il tête-à-tête, lo capisco al volo
Vorrei darti il vecchio me ma preferisco il nuovo
E sono stanco ormai di correre
Di pensare che ogni bastardo mi voglia fottere
In parole povere
Son stanco di vedere che ti parlo e non mi stai ascoltando
Ma aspettando per rispondere
Che cazzo...
Mi aspetta una staffetta illimitata
Ma so già che la mia vetta è meritata
Di notte vedo mostri con la faccia ribaltata
La vendetta privata
In una cassetta piratata
Poi la luce si fa fioca, la pupilla dilatata
Per i soldi, per la droga e per la vita dilaniata
Vorrei che tu vedessi con che faccia disperata
Mi guarda mia mamma quando me ne vado via di casa
Fanculo!
Quando ci si guarda dentro, qui non ride più nessuno
E devo stare attento
Per uscire in tempo da questo tunnel buio
Perché mi hanno detto che pensare uccide più del fumo
E non pensare che non sia sensibile
Ma me ne frego di quello che credi sia credibile
Ti sei mai chiesto quanto sia difficile decidere se
Vivere per scrivere o se scrivere per vivere?
Ma l'uomo è un animale e devi urlare più forte
Se non vuoi diventare il suo giullare di corte
Per imparare qui devi sbagliare un quintale di volte
E provare ad andare oltre
Tu non ragionare ad onde corte
Non si può spiegare, nonsense
Senza allungare gambe corte
Raddrizzare piante storte
Anteporre il male e ignorare quanto sangue scorre

[Bridge: Nitro]
La mia vita è un cortometraggio, racconto di un saggio
Dove il protagonista sembra morto nel viaggio
Ti ho già perso di vista
Mentre affondo tra il fango, il rimorso, il rimpianto
Ogni giorno m'incazzo
Pur di non tenere addosso il volto del falso
È un problema grosso e non hai colto il messaggio
Se crollo mi rialzo e mi prendo sto mondo del cazzo
Se è vero che...

[Hook: Vegas Jones] [x2]
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Come scorre un fiume di parole
Falle scivolare e sarai superiore
Il cielo farà il suo dovere
Trankilo, va tutto apposto
Ieri mi sentivo perso
Ora è diverso, oggi mi sento benedetto

[Intro]
Ronny J, listen up

[Hook]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

[Verse 1]
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate
Hey, young boy had to penetrate
Face, young boy done caught a case
Bang, now his mama living with the pain
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay
Let him get the senzu bean so he regenerate
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state
Denzel Curry is the new candidate
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus
Bitches be bopping it, bow down and pop it in
Dropping it in her esophagus
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it
Girl, I can make you a star
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist
Ripping through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm living so harmonious
Feeling like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics, bitch, I'm ultimate
Ultimate, bitch I'm

[Hook]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

[Verse 2]
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, is he fake, is he real
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Dropping melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fucking with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches looking thirsty
Riding through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story

[Hook]
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family

The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates

[Intro]
This is called being high as shit, for hours
That's the name of this song, nigga
"High as Shit for Hours"
Here we go, yeah

[Verse 1]
American hypocrisy, oh, let me count the ways
They came here seekin' freedom
Then they end up ownin' slaves
Justified it usin' Christianity which saves
Religion don't mean shit, there's too much ego in the way
That's why ISIS is a crisis
But in reality this country do the same shit
Take a life and call it righteous
Remember when Bin Laden got killed, supposedly?
In a hotel lobby after a show, was noticin'
These white ladies watchin' CNN, coverin' the action
They read the headline and then they all started clappin'
As if LeBron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
I stood there for a second, watched them high-five each other
For real? I thought this was "Thou shalt not kill"
But police still lettin' off on niggas in the Ville
Claimin' that he reached for a gun
They really think we dumb and got a death wish
Now somebody's son is layin' breathless
When I was a little boy my father lived in Texas
Pulled up in Toyota, drove that bitch like it was Lexus
Put my bag in his trunk and headed off for Dallas
Out there for the summer, feelin' just like I was Alice
Lost in the Wonderland where niggas still sufferin'
Just like they was back home, and that's wrong
So now it's "Fuck the government!"
They see my niggas strugglin'
And they don't give a fuck at all, and that's wrong, yeah

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 2]
I had a convo with the President, I paid to go and see him
Thinkin' about the things I said I'd say when I would see him
Feelin' nervous, sittin' in a room full of white folks
Thinkin' about the black man plight, think I might choke
Nope, raised my hand and asked a man a question
Does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression?
And if so, if you got all the power in the clout
As the President, what's keepin' you from helpin' niggas out?
Well, I didn't say "nigga," but you catch my drift
He looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
He broke the issues down and showed me he was well-aware
I got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
But dawg, you in the chair, what's the hold up?
He said, "There's things that I wanna fix
But you know this shit, nigga: politics."
Don't stop fightin' and don't stop believin'
You can make the world better for your kids before you leave it
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back 'til they kill me
Change is slow, always has been, always will be
But fuck that, I'ma bust back until they kill me—feel me?

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna (Aight, third verse)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

[Verse 3]
Here's a thought for my revolutionary heart
Take a deeper look at history, it's there to pick apart
See, the people at the top, they get to do just what they want
'Til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
Then they start to holla "Revolution!"
Tired of livin' here, destitution
Fuck that lootin'! Can you tell me what's the best solution?
I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors, see
If we destroy the system, that means we'll have less of greed
But see, it's not that simple
I got to thinkin' about the history of human nature
While this instrumental played
Then I realized somethin' that made
Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
Think about this shit for a second, you heard the way
The children in abusive households grow up
Knockin' girlfriends out cold—that's called a cycle
Abused becomes the abuser and that's just how life go
So understand
You get the power, but you know what power does to man?
Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
So when you talk 'bout revolution
Dawg, I hear just what you sayin'
What good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you
I said, what good is takin' over
When we know what you gon' do?
The only real revolution happens right inside of you, nigga

[Hook]
The type of shit that make you wanna (High for hours, nigga)
The type of shit that make you wanna let go (Volume one)
The type of shit that make you wanna
The type of shit that make you wanna let go

Look, give me the ball and I will have to pass it
I ain't passing out until I'm asthma attacking
I take a plan and then I back-to-back it
Hit after hit, check the batting average
I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that "pew! pew!" hit your ass from like way, oh, ways, away

I got the moves

[Outro]
Look, I'm a Don, I'm a Don, I'm a Don (Don)

Touch any of the above, now you're harder to find
Gone

And man are hatin' but they wavin' when they saw me on their strip, I know
I know they see me on the camera

Mix the gentleman with gangster

[Verse 1: J Hus]
Quickly stop off at the off-licence
Bossman, let me get a two two drink
Gyaldem ah' watch my 'ting
How 'bout a crook and a princess combining
And I've been givin' gyal the good pipe
And man walked in, yo, it's not what it looks like
Give man high five, kiss her goodnight
I'm in your eyesight
But I'm not your type, I'm more like your life
Keep quiet, I'm preaching
Put a sock in it, put a sock on the fire alarm
Fingers lookin' like a fire arm
Well I spit this fire
Plus I came with the fire
Um, what's that ting with the silencer?
Man come through and silence 'em
I was never the cool kid
More like strange and awkward
Biscuit for your forehead
Tore my forearms exhausted
I been road my fortress
Spent four months in the forefront
We party for a fortnight
But I was too weak by the fourth night

We are not Gs, I am not from your ends
I don't give a fuck what you done
Two young Gs, arms out, nobody move, you can get stuck in the mud
We sent your man to the shop
What do you mean? He ain't ever made it rain
Your man is a fraud, your boyfriend's livin' a lie
You're kinda like Rachel Zane
I'm gentle when it comes to the girl dem
But I'm gangster with some voddy and voss
My girl don't wanna stop for a chat
Then I'm onto her friends like Joey and Ross
Babe, what you mean you can't talk for a sec?
It's calm, you don't even know what you lost
Stone Island from my head to my feet
When I step on the street, I dunno what it cost, but
I know it's expensive
She told me she love me but really I don't even know if she meant it
And if feds pull this whip, that's numerous offences
Why you gassed off a rack?
I put three on my dentins, I put three on my dentins

[Bridge: J Hus]
Close your eyes, it might be blinding
And they wonder why I'm smiling
Until I hear a siren, we pulled off in perfect timing
Close your eyes, it might be blinding

I got so many felonies
I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings
So let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its
And it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister
Guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all red drop tarantula
Fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh
Where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up
Hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck
You're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge
Try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin
When she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig
But you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig?
You grew up with me

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout out Yachty but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Hook: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Mike Will Made It Nigga
Sremm Life
Black Barbies in the city
Fat ass and pretty titties
Get dummies for they money
You sent flowers but I wish I didn't receive ’em
All your lies I wish I didn't believe 'em

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
That boy is a real pussy pleaser
All that fetty but he never met Masika
Tuck the chrome 22 in his sneaker
El Chapo but he crazy like La Quica
Young girls always lookin' for a soulmate
But I shoulda listened to what momma told me
Furry moon boots, shades Dita
Too high to give a shit about PETA

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Sativa so strong I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
New things for them to imitate
I'm a fuckin' black barbie
Pretty face, perfect body
Pink seats in the 'Rari
Always fuck him like I'm sorry
Who the fuck is gon’ protect her?
If I really gotta check her
Peter Piper picked a pepper
And my cake is triple decker

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
No Flex Zone, No Flex Zone
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no) No Flex Zone

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I see these silly nigga’s flexin', it’s a no zone
You gon' be floatin' in dem rivers like you know Joan
Island girl, Donald Trump want me go home
Still pull up with my wrist lookin' like a snowcone
She said she got a hit record, I said "Oooh shit!"
Picked up my phone cause I had to call "Bullshit!"
These bitches havin’ nightmares of my new shit
These bitches pussy and they don't ever do shit
Hahaha, get it? Douche-...hahahahahahaha

Niggas love me so much they be sendin' me gifts
And these clown niggas actin', I'mma send 'em some skits
Bitches can't rap for shit, I'mma send 'em some tips
All these bitches is my sons, should be suckin' my tits

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Now usually I don't do this, I'm Popeye, she's Brutus
Usually I'm a Christian but this peace is Buddhist
All of my niggas draw but none of them Cartoonists
Usually I'm the baddest, usually I'm the cutest
Usually I'm the flyest, usually you're the stewardess
And we ain't playin' ball but usually its some shooters
Are these bitches drunk? These bitches ain't lucid
Go against the queen your career will be elusive
Where your plaques at? Where them stocks? Word to NASDAQ
Bitches ass-back, they was never in my tax-brack
(Yeah, oh no, no, no, no, yeah, oh no, no, no, no)

[Outro: Swae Lee]
That girl is a real crowd pleaser
Small world, all her friends know of me
Young bull living like an old geezer
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly
Frat girls still tryna get even
Haters mad for whatever reason
Smoke in the air, binge drinking
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle

[Hook]
Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, "There he go!"
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

[Verse 1]
Ay, Lil Kodak on the beat I got that bass, ho
Boy I drop that shit that they be waitin' for
I like the Beamer but I'm about to go cop a Wraith tho'
I done peeped your true colors, boy you a rainbow
I got Space Jams on my feet, I'm on the moon
I'm really lit, so I ain't gotta use no auto-tune
Yeah, I'm the shit, but you know damn well I ain't number two
I'm in this bih' around some niggas who ain't got nothin' to lose
But shawty got that head, she got that fire brain
She know I love the head, I love that migraine
You ain't never run off with a boss ainna
She know a nigga be stunting like a Power Ranger

These ain't Ray-bans, these Saint Laurent shades, ho
The way my niggas hit your block, you'd think it's Halo
No more home invadin now, I'm on the radio
I don't even like to fuck, I only want fellatio
I done jumped out to that bag, baby check my swag
Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ay, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

[Speech]
Next nigga to fuck with me, gon' be stuck with me with his stuck ass. Bitch. Watch, look. Hold up, l-l-look, no time. Okay?

[Intro]
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I

[Verse 1]
Up for hours drinking
Posted up, just reflecting on it
And I know you won't believe me
But babe, I'm cold and yeah, this life is cold
I say swear you won't come near me
Keep your heart cause I could fuck you up
Or have you never thinking clearly, never thinking clearly
Have you all up in your feelings
Experienced, I did it times before
And I can see you from a distance
I could fuck you now and years later on
You gon' be stuck, just reminiscing
It's the way I ride you, let you stay inside
Yeah, I'ma fuck you like a vixen
There's something 'bout me

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear you see the good in me
But that don't beat the hood in me
And I got my intentions and use
Guess I'm make believe
Cause baby I know, baby, I know

[Chorus]
I—I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I—I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

[Verse 2]
Up for days, been rolling
Sweating bullets, don't regret the choices
That I made 'cause I'm still growing
Sign the deal and then they cut the check
And ever since, my color's showing
Change the scene, the things are better now
And you know the wave is never slowing
The wave is never slowing
I know that you will miss me
You liked it when I used to leave a wound
And promise I would come and kiss it
I fed you lies and you just ate 'em up
And I don't care to do the dishes
I ain't no wifey, ain't gon' hold you down
It's way more fun to be the mistress
I know I'm not like other bitches

[Pre-Chorus]
Swear you see the good in me
But that don't beat the hood in me
And I got my intentions and use
Guess I'm make believe 'cause baby, I know, baby, I know

[Chorus]
I—I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I—I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

[Bridge]
You want all my time
But I don't got enough
Baby, I can put it down
But I can't put it up
I got too much time to live
Well I'm still way too young
I'm still way too young, yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma do you dirty
I—I'ma do you dirty
Say you love me now
But baby, it's too early
I—I'ma do you dirty
You think you love me now
I think you should be worried

[Hook]
These niggas prayed on my downfall
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse 1]
Go get the thermometer for the pot
I need this shit cooked right
Lets keep this water four hundred degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Being broke did something to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, driving German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, remember I used to use your L's to hit the road
Hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, remember when you had them green things mailed with vacuum seals
Trying not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money
I don't know nothing, I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you everyday before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers coming in and out of court
Aye Won though, aye Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle

[Beat change]

[Verse 2]
Aye JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down
Pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill you
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas hoe me, quit being silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doing better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gone drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, get ahead of them niggas
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends happy, bling dancing, eating sixty dollar salad
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fucking shoulders (Boom boom boom!)
You hear me? hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? a Jag Portfolio
You hear me? aye I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feeling hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the hoe in niggas
Free my nigga Perico, that boy be hoeing niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy I can't trust you with that strap if you don't got no bodies
Boy I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think I was coming home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cumming on
Get em to the crib, bust em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shaking like there's something wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch I came home to my lil brother gone
Niggas say they looking for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fucking, put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds trying to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch I'm two and oh
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here
They don't know what he on

[Hook]
I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall
On all ten bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
It's party, party, party like a nigga just got out of jail
Flyin' in my 'rari like a bat that just flew outta hell
I'm from the east of ATL, but ballin' in the Cali hills
Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still
I'm tryna fuck, who tryna chill? 'Cause I'm just tryna pay some bills
I'm multi millionare LaFlare, this watch here cost a quarter M
Just look at me and look at them, I smashed her on my first attempt
Like Scarface bitch, the world is mine, you should read the blimp
So either you gon' take a ride, or you gon' stay with him
'Cause I got places I can be, I get yo ass on the scene
Gucci, CB VIP, so fuck them niggas, look at me, Wop
